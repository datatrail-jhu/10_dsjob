# What You Need to Find a Data Science Job

Whenever you're looking for a job, in data science or otherwise, there are a number of things that you're required to submit to officially apply for a job, such as a cover letter and a resume. However, for data science jobs, there are a number of other steps you should take outside of what you submit to each company to give yourself the best chance at getting the job you're interested in! We'll discuss the ins- and outs- of those official documents (resume, cover letter, etc) and those less official letters.

- a linkedin profile
- a github profile with projects

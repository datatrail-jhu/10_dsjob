However, for data science jobs, there are a number of other steps you should take outside of what you submit to each company to give yourself the best chance at getting the job you’re interested in! These include ensuring you have a personal website and that it is up to date and ensuring that all your professional social media accounts are up-to-date! In this lesson, in particular, we’ll cover an overview of what you need to find a data science job. And, then, in the lessons that follow, we’ll discuss the ins- and outs- of those official documents (resume, cover letter, etc) and those less official steps to take (updated website, Twitter presence, etc.), helping to ensure you get each of these set up to move forward. Note that there will be a lot to do throughout this course, but that’s what it takes to get a job! So, read carefully, follow along, and make all the updates and changes outlined throughout this course to start preparing yourself for looking for a position! 1.0.1 Job Applications When applying to jobs, they minimally will require you to submit a cover letter and a resume. {format: png} 1.0.1.1 Resumes Resumes are (typically) one page documents that include how to contact you along with information about your education, skills, and experience. They are meant to be read at a glance, so they should be brief, clear, well-formatted, and include only the essential information. 1.0.1.2 Cover Letters In addition to a resume which will not change much from one job application to the next, you will also submit a cover letter. A cover letter is supposed to convey both why you’re interested in the job to which you’re applying and why you’d be a great fit for that job. These should also not exceed one page. 1.0.2 Online Presence In addition to the official job application materials, the individuals responsible for hiring decisions at the company where you’re submitting your application will have access to the Internet. This means that if you get through their initial screening, where they look at your cover letter and resume, they’ll likely search for you on the Internet. This means that your online presence should always be up to date when you’re applying for jobs. {format: png} 1.0.2.1 Personal Website Specifically, you will want to have a personal website. In an earlier course in this Course Set, we helped get you up and running with a website; however, in this course, we’ll be sure that this website is set up for applying to jobs! 1.0.2.2 Social Media In addition to a personal website it will be important to have your GitHub, LinkedIn and Twitter profiles up-to-date. Briefly here we’ll discuss why this is important and in the lessons in this course, we’ll walk through the steps necessary to take to get everything ready for applying to jobs. GitHub - hiring managers will look here to see work you’ve done and how much you’ve worked with others LinkedIn - is a great place to get more details beyond what is included on your resume Twitter - is where you’ll want to share your work and support the work of others It’s important that each of these profiles are up-to-date, contain all the information hiring managers would want to see, and are easy to find. We’ll make sure you’re all set with this throughout this course! 1.0.3 Additional Resources How to be a modern scientist, by Jeff Leek 1.0.4 Slides and Video What You Need to Find a Data Science Job Slides "],["resumes-1.html", "Chapter 2 Resumes", " Chapter 2 Resumes When applying to jobs, you’ll almost certainly be asked to submit a resume. Anyone can write a resume, but it’s critical that you submit a good resume when applying to jobs. We’ll discuss how to generate a good data science resume in this lesson. 2.0.1 What is a Resume? First and foremost a resume is a short document that describes one’s qualifications for a job. More specifically, this document will include your contact information, a brief summary of your qualifications, your experience, and education. And, importantly, this document will be short (usually, no more than one page) and easy to read. This means that the document must be organized, well-formatted, and clearly written. 2.0.2 General Features Before we jump into each of the sections on a resume, let’s review a few general features of resumes. First, resumes are brief. Resumes should almost certainly not exceed one page. If you feel like you have too much to say in a single page, consider the organization and formatting of your current resume. Do not consider going to a second page. Those reviewing your application should be able to glance at your resume quickly and garner the information they need. Do not count on them turning to a second page. Instead, put all the pertinent information on that first page. Second, bullet points are ok. Resumes are intended to be read quickly, so full sentences are not necessarily required. Bullet points are easier to read quickly than paragraphs. Thus, use bullet points on resumes. Third, use action words. Action words that describe what you did for specific projects or at a previous job should be used on your resume. And, the words you use should vary. If you led a project, you could use “Chaired,” “organized,” or “oversaw.” If you carried out the work on a project you may use “developed,” “designed,” “implemented,” or “devised.” If you saved your company money with the results of a previous analysis, you’d use words like “conserved,” “reduced,” or “decreased.” The purpose of these examples here is not to state the best action words to use on your resume, but rather it’s to demonstrate that there are a lot of action words out there. Use them. And vary the ones you use. Don’t simply use “Developed” over and over again throughout your resume. Fourth, your resume should be organized and well-formatted. The goal of your resume is for a hiring manager to look at your resume, learn about you, and want to hire you at a glance. Thus, be sure that the hiring manager is not focused on the poor spacing, the small font, the hard-to-read color, or the disorganization of your resume. Be sure that the most important information jumps off the page and that nothing is hard to read on your resume. Fifth, when organizing your resume, put information in reverse chronological order. This means the most recent things should be first within a section and the oldest things should be last. Finally, everything on your resume must be truthful. Do not falsify any information on your resume. Do not include things you plan to do but have not yet done. Lying on your resume is never acceptable, no matter the circumstance. 2.0.3 Formatting To ensure that your resume is formatted appropriately, we’ll discuss a few guidelines here. At the end of this lesson, we’ll include a few sample resumes though and you’ll see just how vastly resumes can differ visually and still be good resumes. 2.0.3.1 Fonts The font you use on your resume should be easy too read. Avoid script fonts or ones that look like something a small child would write. Stick to fonts that can be read with ease. Times New Roman has been used historically; however, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, and Calibri are also easy to read. 2.0.3.2 Font Size Your name will likely be the largest piece of information on your resume. However, nothing on the page should be hard to read. Generally, for most fonts, the smallest font size you should use is 10 point. Section headers should be larger than the smallest font on the page but smaller than your name. 2.0.3.3 Colors Sometimes, resumes will use color. This could be used to make your name and section headers stand out. Stick to colors that will show up regardless of whether the document is printed in color or black and white. This means that darker colors are safer. Navy blue or deep purple are better than sky blue or pastel purple, for example. 2.0.3.4 Be Consistent Don’t use too many different colors. If you use a color for one section header, that exact same color should be used for all the section headers. The same goes for font and font size. Do not distract readers by using lots of different fonts. And, be sure that each element of your resume uses a consistent font size. Text in one section should be the same size as text in another section. Section headers should all be the same size. Spacing between the sections should be consistent. Consistency is key. {format: png} 2.0.4 What to Include Now that we’ve covered some resume basics, we’ll step through what you should include on your resume. 2.0.4.1 Name &amp; Contact Information First and foremost, your name and contact information should be included and should be at the top of your resume. This will include your mailing address, but should also include an email address and phone number. Further, for data science jobs, you should also consider your GitHub username and personal website. This will be a recurring theme in the lessons throughout this course. From each location, be it your resume, GitHub, or personal website, viewers should be able to easily access all other platforms where your information is stored. It should be easy to navigate to information about you between all platforms. That said, it’s not necessary to put your LinkedIn or Twitter handle on your resume, unless the employer requests it. 2.0.4.2 Brief summary While the general rule for resumes is that bullet points are ok, the summary is the one exception to that rule. This should be a short (2-3 sentences) paragraph that summarizes your qualifications for the job to which you’re applying and what you’re looking forward to doing at that position. While most of the information on your resume does not change as you apply to different jobs, this section should change and be specific to the job to which you’re applying. 2.0.4.3 Skills In addition to stating who you are, how to get in contact with you, and where to learn more about you, it’s imperative that your resume highlight the pertinent skills you have for the job to which you’re applying. For data science positions, this section should specifically explain your programming and data analysis skills. If you’ve completed the courses in this course set, you’d be sure to include that you are comfortable in R and are skilled at data wrangling, data visualization, and basic data analysis. However, for any skill you state you possess, you should demonstrate examples of actually having and applying these skills in your experience section (discussed below). 2.0.4.4 Education Your educational history should be included on your resume. Each entry should include the institution, what degree or diploma you earned, the years in which you attended the institution, and the city and state where that institution is located. This section should also include online programs (such as this one, once you’ve fully completed it!) and any pertinent other job training, such as workshops attended or other pertinent certificates earned. Note that you should not include certificates you’ve earned that are not related to the job to which you’re applying. Once completed, this Course Set should be included in this section. However, you should not include this on your resume until you’ve completed the entire Course Set. 2.0.4.5 Experience Finally, your previous job experience should be included here. If you have years of data science experience, then it’s not necessary to include other, unrelated jobs. However, if you have years of job experience demonstrating your commitment to working for a company for an extended period of time but don’t yet have data science experience, put this job down. Employers want to see that you have worked at a job for a period of time. After stating the employer, your title, and the location of each position, it’s customary to include bullet points of your responsibilities and projects worked on while employed. This is where it’s crucial to use bullet points, action words, and to be clear and concise. This section demonstrates to the employer your experience and what role you played at your former positions! If you don’t yet have pertinent job experience, this section should include information about projects you’ve worked on. 2.0.4.6 Projects This section is not generally required, as the bullet points explaining what you’ve done at previous jobs should explain the projects you’ve worked on and the role you played. However, if you don’t have formal data science experience working with a company, it’s incredibly important to demonstrates what projects you’ve worked on. These could be projects you’ve worked on throughout your coursework in this course set. Or, these could be projects you’ve worked on on your own. We’ll talk about your project gallery and what it should include in a later lesson; however, it’s important to show to employers that you’re interested in data science work and have worked on projects on your own time. These projects should certainly be included and described on your resume, especially if you do not yet have official data science experience. 2.0.5 Example Resumes To demonstrate how to format a data science resume, we’ll walk through a few examples. Note, none of these examples are actual data science resumes for real people. Rather, we’re using these as templates to highlight how to organize a data science resume. 2.0.5.1 Classic Historically, resumes have not been visually stunning. They’ve been clear and well-organized with a focus on formatting; however, they have been visually standard with one section after another. Bold and underlined text have been used to highlight text with section headers sometimes being a different color and generally being a larger font size. Here, we see an example of one such resume: {format: png} We’ll highlight a number of features of this type of resume to draw your attention to important aspects of a data science resume. First, notice that the applicants name and contact information are right at the top of the resume, and the name in particular stands out. {format: png} Second, note that the font size, spacing between lines and sections, and chosen fonts are consistent throughout the resume. {format: png} Additionally, the expected sections are present and separated visually from one another. Further, within each section, bullet points are used and the text are aligned consistently from one point within the section to the next {format: png} Note that no resume is perfect. In fact, there are many things that could be improved about this resume. For example, white space is to be avoided whenever possible on a resume. So blocks of white, empty spaces are opportunities to explain what you’ve done. This does not mean that you need to add more text to fill space. Rather, maybe font size could be increased or a different layout would have been able to display the important information more effectively. Additionally, the Projects section could use work. There are too many bullet points for Projects. Three to four bullet points for any one topic is usually plenty. We would want to see if we could remove one of these bullet points. Also, the bullet points are smushed up against the underlined project name. It would be best to add a small space after the project name and the bullet points. {format: png} After noticing these, we would want to go back to the resume and make these improvements before applying! Your resume will be one of the first things seen by your possible future employer. You want to be sure to put your best foot forward! 2.0.5.2 Creative Recently, with the frequency of data scientist positions within smaller startups, there has been some room for flexibility and creativity in data science resume design. Going with the classic design is a safer route; however, for positions where creativity is something the position is looking for, it may be ok to go with a somewhat different resume design. Here we see an example of a less traditional resume. Information very similar to what was seen in the last example is displayed; however, the formatting is very different. We’ll similarly walk through this resume design highlighting what it does well and where it could be improved. {format: png} As we saw in the last example, the applicant’s name and contact information are clearly at the top of the resume. Here, the addition of small icons makes this information slightly more appealing. {format: png} However, unlike in the classic view, sections are not spaced one on top of the other. While all the same sections are still there, the page is separated using one gray block in the middle to highlight projects the applicant has used. And, sections are separated using either blue text, or white text within blue shapes. These do not all start at the left end of the page. Instead, they can be either on the left or in a second column on the page. {format: png} As mentioned above, no resume is perfect. Maybe the gray is a little too dark. Maybe you wish you had more room to talk about your skills, as you did in the traditional resume view, but that you don’t have with this layout. Or, maybe the hiring manager won’t like this type of resume, as it’s not what they’re used to looking at. By choosing to use a less-traditional resume type, you’re taking a risk. It may make your resume stand out, or it could confuse be something the company doesn’t like. Know that there are risks behind using a less-traditional resume. It’s important to consider the limitations of your resume and the changes you should make to improve it before submitting it with your application! {format: png} 2.0.6 Sharing your resume Last, once your resume has been written and formatted, you’re all ready to send it to employers. This should always be in the PDF format! After saving your resume as a PDF, always open it up, take a look at it, and make sure the formatting looks perfect in this format. If there are things you want to change, go back and edit your resume. Then, re-save as a PDF and look at the formatting. Do this until your resume is perfect. You wouldn’t want a hiring manager to skip over you because your resume can’t be read easily or is missing information. It’s certainly worth it to spend a great deal of time on your resume. 2.0.7 Summary In this lesson we’ve reviewed the general guidelines for resume writing, the important features of any resume, and a few examples of data science resumes. It’s best at this point to get working on your resume. You’ll be asked to submit a link to your resume in a lesson later in this course as a quiz response. And, while you’ll always have to update this document and there will always be ways to improve its appearance, the hardest part is getting a first draft, so get working on that now! 2.0.8 Additional Resources Data Science Resume Examples Advice for Applying to Data Science Jobs Example Resume Templates - Classic ; Creative 2.0.9 Slides and Video Resumes Slides {quiz, id: quiz_01_resume} 2.0.10 Resumes quiz {choose-answers: 4} ?

While the goal of your resume is to provide hiring managers with information about your qualifications for the position, the goal of a cover letter is meant to demonstrate that you are the right person for the job and convey your personality while still being professional. As such, the cover letter you write should be tailored specifically for each and every job application you submit. Since the company you apply to will have both your cover letter and your resume, your cover letter should not discuss every aspect of your career and educational history. In fact, that’s in your resume, so don’t make people read the same information twice. Instead, your cover letter should should be memorable. This can be accomplished by telling a story or two about your background as it pertains to this job in particular. Or, you can talk about your personality and skills and give examples of things you’ve accomplished using these that will help you succeed in this position. Finally, cover letters are a place to express why you want to work at the organization or company to which you’re applying. The cover letter is a great place to express all of these sentiments. As with your resume and every aspect of any job application, all information contained within your cover letter must be true. If a job is in London and you have no desire to move to London, then don’t state that you have been looking forward to a London move for years in your cover letter. Similarly, if you tend to be a serious and not bubbly person, don’t give off the impression that you’re a bubbly individual through the stories and language used in your cover letter. To note, being a serious or bubbly person are both fine personality traits to possess! The important thing however is that you only ever convey information about yourself that is true. Finally, always proofread your cover letter (and all your application materials!) before submitting your application. Typos and grammatical errors reflect poorly upon you. It’s worth the extra effort to ensure that you do not have errors in your cover letter! 3.0.1 Format Unlike a resume where there are sections that hiring managers expect to see and will be looking for, cover letters are a lot more flexible in their contents and format. The cover letter should in fact be a letter, so it should follow the following general format; however, what is contained in each of the paragraphs can vary a lot from one letter to the next: {format: png} You’ll note here that your contact information should be at the top of your letter. Then, in the letter itself, you should include the date and then address the letter to the hiring manager or recruiter specifically. The hiring manager’s work address should then be included. {format: png} Note that it’s best to figure out the name of this individual rather than addressing the letter “To whom it may concern.” Make the effort to figure out who will be reading this letter by searching on the Internet or talking to individuals at the company. {format: png} After including your contact information and the company’s information, you’ll address the hiring manager specifically and then begin your letter. Cover letters need only be a few paragraphs and should not exceed a single page. We’ll discuss what should be in those paragraphs in the next section of this lesson. {format: png} Finally, close your letter and include your name on the line after your closing (i.e. “Sincerely,”). {format: png} This is the basic format of a cover letter. Here, we’ve shown a basic template with minimal formatting. However, you can change the colors or layout to best fit your personality and the type of company to which you’re applying. New startups will likely have fewer expectations as to the format of your cover letter, where you have some more flexibility in changing up the letter’s appearance. Corporations that have been around for a long time may have a greater expectation that your cover letter not stray too far from what you see here. Be sure to adjust the format of the letter to best fit your personality while still matching with the hiring company’s expectations. Regardless though of where you’re applying, avoid fonts that are hard to read, be sure that the layout and formatting does not distract the reader from the content, and save your cover letter as a PDF to ensure the formatting of your letter appears to the hiring manager as it does to you. 3.0.2 Content Now that we’ve discussed the general format of the cover letter, let’s discuss what is expected to be in each of these paragraphs within the body of your cover letter. 3.0.2.1 Intro The goal of your introductory paragraph is to draw your reader’s attention in. Open with a unique line and be sure to express in this paragraph that you have a clear understanding of what the company does and what they care about. Additionally, mention a few roles you’ve had, projects you’ve worked on, traits you possess, or passions you have that make you an ideal candidate for the position. {format: png} 3.0.2.2 Body The body of the paragraph should include specific examples of experiences you’ve had or things you’ve accomplished that align with the keywords stated in the job description. If the job description states they are looking for someone “passionate about data,” it is not sufficient to say “I’m passionate about data” in your letter. Rather, give an example of your passion. Was there a time when you came across an article in the news and just had to find the data and analyze it yourself? Tell that story! Tell what you found. Or, was there a time that you generated a dataset to answer a question in your own life that had been in the back of your mind for a while. Tell that story! Be sure to use a specific example or two and at least a few of the keywords stated in the job description in this section. Talk about your work, accomplishments, passions, and interests in this section and use specific examples. {format: png} 3.0.2.3 Closing There is a balance to be struck in the closing. You want to summarize the interests, qualifications, and passion you’ve already stated in the letter, but you do not want to simply repeat what has already been said. Be sure that you’re summarizing without simply repeating. You never want the hiring manager to think “didn’t they already say this?” while reading your letter. Be sure to include how you would specifically contribute to the company given your attributes and skillset. Let your personality shine through in this paragraph. {format: png} 3.0.2.4 Call-To-Action Give the reader a reason to contact you. This does not mean you should include things like “I’ll call to schedule an interview.” That is off-putting, overly-aggressive, and not your place. It is their job to contact you about a possible interview. Instead, your call-to-action should be a polite suggestion, such as “I’m excited to hear from you and look forward to the opportunity to provide you with more information.” Additionally, it’s best to thank the reader for reading your letter at this point in time, with something like “Thank you for taking the time to read this letter, and I look forward to discussing this position with you more in the future.” {format: png} 3.0.3 What to Avoid We’ve hinted on a few things to avoid in cover letters throughout this lesson, but we figured it would be best to summarize them all in one place here: Do your best to avoid: fonts or colors that are hard to read instead: stick to dark colors and simple fonts starting your letter with “To Whom It May Concern” or “Dear Sir/Madam” instead: take the time to figure out who will be reading this letter using generalized statements like “I’d be a perfect fit” without explanation instead: use specific examples to back up that statement instead: tell a story from your experience that explains why this is true instead: use keywords from the job description and specific examples from your experience being overly-aggressive instead: express enthusiasm and interest while still being professional overused phrases instead: be honest and specific in all your statements including unnecessary information instead: edit your letter to only include important information instead: pare down to just what’s essential typos or grammatical errors instead: proofread yourself instead: have someone else also proofread plagiarism - never copy anyone else’s writing instead: use your own words and experiences to let your personality shine through instead: avoid copy and pasting from examples of others’ cover letters 3.0.4 Summary In this lesson, we’ve reviewed the goals, format and content of a cover letter that will make you stand out. If you let your personality come through the letter and stick to using examples and stories that are specific to your experience, you’ll have a cover letter that is unique and that is not simply glossed over by the individual in charge of hiring. Take the time to ensure that your cover letter is neither boring nor generic. 3.0.5 Additional Resources Cover Letters Templates (from this lesson) - skeleton; content Data Science Cover Letters, by Jordan Goldmeier Even for Data and Tech Jobs, a Cover Letter is the Best Way to Sell Your Human Skills, by Stephen Goldmeier 3.0.6 Slides and Video Cover Letters Slides "],["making-your-website-more-professional.html", "Chapter 4 Making Your Website More Professional", " Chapter 4 Making Your Website More Professional In the Introduction to R course earlier in this Course Set, we generated a basic website where you could write about yourself, your interests, and the projects you’ve worked on. (Note: You do not need to have generated this previous website to complete this lesson; however, the directions in this lesson assume that you have. Your steps may differ slightly than what’s presented here when replacing files on GitHub.) However, this was created before you were looking for jobs and before you were comfortable working with R and RStudio Cloud! In this lesson, now that you have these skills and are more comfortable, we’ll update the look of your website using the blogdown package. In this lesson, we’ll cover both how to add more information to your website and how to make it more professional. In doing this, we’ll provide examples from others’ websites. We hope that by the end of this lesson you’ll have a website is helpful to those interested in hiring you! This will be a long lesson, but it will be worth it. Go through each step in RStudio Cloud as you read through the lesson to update your professional website! 4.0.1 Blogdown blogdown is an R package that helps create websites with R Markdown. There is a whole book dedicated to helping users use this package, so if you want to learn more about blogdown beyond what is covered in this lesson - that book is a great place to start. {format: png} Simply though, blogdown allows users to generate static websites. This means that you will generate HTML files within blogdown that visitors to your website will be able to view. The content will appear the same to the viewer no matter who it is visiting your site. This is perfect for a personal website! 4.0.2 Getting Started In an earlier course in this Course Set, you developed a basic website within RStudio Cloud. At the end of that lesson, you had a website that looked something like this: {format: png} It contained some basic information about you and had information about where to contact you; however, it was pretty basic and not very visually appealing. In this lesson, we’ll improve both the content and look of your personal website. To get started, create a new project in RStudio Cloud! Once you’ve got a new project, you’ll want to run the following code in the R Console to install blogdown and start a new site. (Note: it may take a few minutes for this code to run and for all the dependencies to install.) ## install packages install.packages(&quot;blogdown&quot;) blogdown::install_hugo() ## create a new site ## use the academic theme blogdown::new_site(theme = &quot;gcushen/hugo-academic&quot;) For this site, we’re using the Hugo theme “Academic”, specified as an argument within the blogdown::new_site() function. At the end of this lesson, you’ll have a website that looks something like what you see here! {format: png} There are many other themes that can be used within the blogdown package. We’ve chosen to use this one because it does a good job displaying information about your skills and qualifications as well as your projects, which will be important when you are looking for jobs. Once you run this code, an “Edit” window will pop up. {format: png} Replace the text you see in this document, with a brief introduction about yourself, something similar to what you see here. Click Save. Note that nothing here is permanent. You’ll be able to edit all of this later! {format: png} A new tab will open up in your browser with a (somewhat ugly) preview of your website. We’ll make this look better right away! {format: png} Ok, so this doesn’t exactly look like that website we were looking at before…what’s going on? Well, in order for the preview to appear correctly, we have to make a slight change to how the website looks for links on the website. To do this, open up the config.toml file within the project directory. {format: png} Search for the line baseurl = \"/\". After this line, add the following two lines of code: relativeurls = true canonifyurls = true Additionally, change title to include your name. {format: png} Save these changes. The preview of your website should update automatically in that tab that appeared previously. However, if it doesn’t, you’ll want to run the following in the R Console: ## continually show updates to site blogdown::serve_site() When blogdown::serve_site() is run, every time you save a change to the files of your website, the preview will update and you’ll be able to see what changes have been made and how they’ll appear on your website! Now that you’ve edited those two lines of code in config.toml, your preview should look something like this: {format: png} 4.0.3 Website Content Now that we have the skeleton of the website ready and our theme preview looks as we expected, we’re ready to start editing the content of the website to make it your own. This is where you should edit the text to match your information. Thus, where it says “Jane Doe” in this lesson, put your name in your files. When a description is included, make sure you’re writing information about yourself, and not word for word what’s in this lesson. You really want employers to know about you! 4.0.3.1 Author Details With that all settled, let’s start adding information about you to the website. To do this open the file index.md in the directory /cloud/project/content/author/admin. Now and in the future, you’ll want to edit this file so that it’s always as up-to-date as possible. In this file you’ll want to edit the following sections: * bio : include a brief 1 line about yourself. You’ll write a more complete bio later. * education : feel free to add Cloud-based Data Science and include the URL to the CBDS website: https://www.clouddatascience.org/. Include all of your educational experience here. * email : include your professional email here. Be sure it’s in quotes * interests : add a few interests here. They don’t have to be the same as those included here * name &amp; organizations : be sure to update your name and add any organizations you’re involved with. {format: png} Once you save this file, the changes should be visible on your website preview! You can scroll down to this section or click the “Home” section on the navigation bar at top to see the changes to your website. {format: png} While we’ve got that same _index.md file open, let’s just go ahead and update the rest of your Contact information now. You’ve already added your email, but you’ll want to update your Twitter, and GitHub links. Scroll down to the section labeled “social.” Change the link argument to the link to your twitter. Do the same for the github section. If you don’t have a Google Scholar account to display, just comment out those lines. {format: png} We only have two more things to do to finish up with this section - write a bio and add a picture. 4.0.3.2 Biography Your biography section should a little bit of information briefly describing your current positions and data science interests! To see exactly what we mean, let’s look at a few examples from the websites from people currently working in data science. Here we’re looking at the about section from Nathan Yau’s website. In his about me section, Nathan briefly explains what he does followed by where to find some of his work. He finishes with some of his interests outside of work. If you want to see more of Nathan’s work, check out flowingdata.com. {format: png} Here we have another example from Mona Chalabi, a journalist who generates illustrations from data. Mona introduces what she does, describes where to find her work, and then provides some background information about her professional work. {format: png} Our final example comes from someone whose work you’ve seen throughout this course, David Robinson. In his about me, he mentions his current position and interests, describes briefly some of his work, and provides a bit of background. {format: png} These three examples should give you an idea of what to include in the “About Me” section of your website. Generally, consider including: current position (if applicable) background information where to find projects you’ve worked on Having looked at a few other individuals’ websites, write your biography text at the end of the _index.md file we’ve been working with so far. {format: png} Once you save, these changes to the icons and bio displayed on your home page will be visible. {format: png} 4.0.3.3 Picture While there is currently an avatar image on your site, you want this to be a picture of you! Within the same directory (/cloud/project/content/author/admin) upload a file containing a picture of you. {format: png} Once the file is uploaded, we’ll have to go specify to your website that we want to use this file, and not avatar.jpg. To do so, navigate to cloud/project/config/_default and open the params.toml file. Look for the line that says gravatar = false. Under that line add the line avatar = 'female.png', where female.png is replaced with the filename of the file you uploaded. {format: png} Once these changes are saved, the preview of your website should have your image on it! {format: png} 4.0.3.4 Contact Information With the basic information for our website edited and a picture of ourselves now visible on the preview, it’s time to edit all our contact information. To do this, we’ll continue to make edits within the params.toml file. Update the email address to include your email address but remove the phone and address information, leaving just the empty quotation marks. Similarly, set office hours = \"\" and appointment_url = \"\". Finally, within the contact_links, comment out all the lines so that they are not displayed. If you change your mind in the future and want any of this information displayed in your contact section, you can uncomment any of these lines and update the links to your pages. {format: png} By editing this text, the Contact section of your website will only display a form by which someone can email you to contact you. This is sufficient for now, but you can add additional information in the future, should you need to. Once these changes are saved, your preview will be edited and you can see what your Contact page looks like. {format: png} 4.0.3.5 Website Tabs On the last preview, you see that there are currently six tabs at the top of the preview. However, we won’t need all of those tabs. We’re going to pare down these tabs to only include the most important information. But, in the future, should you want to add any of these back in, you’ll know how to do so. To start customizing these tabs, we’ll want to be sure that your most up-to-date resume is available on your website! To get started on this, you’ll need to upload your resume into the cloud/project/static directory. Here, our resume is saved as resume.pdf. {format: png} Now, we’re ready to start tweaking the tabs available on our website! To do this, we’ll still be making edits to a file we haven’t yet worked with. Open cloud/project/config/_default/menus.toml. Navigate to the portion of the file shown here. Comment out the four lines related to “Publications” and the four lines related to “Tutorials”. This will remove these links from the top of your website. The lines you should delete are highlighted here: {format: png} Then, make the following changes: Change the “weight” for each tab so that they match what you see in the image below (This specifies the order in which the tabs will appear on your website) remove the comments from the four lines related to your “Resume” change the name to “Resume” Specify the filename of the resume you updated. Include your filename in the url line. {format: png} Now, once these changes are saved, you’ll have five tabs on your website preview. Publications and Talks will have been removed, but Resume will have been added! {format: png} 4.0.4 Website Appearance Things are really coming along! We have all of our contact and necessary information included on our homepage now! But, there are lots of changes we will still want to make before our website is ready. Now, we’ll focus on how to improve the overall appearance of our website! 4.0.4.1 Hero Widget While the contact information looks great, there’s information at the top of our website that doesn’t need to be there (and that we’ve kind of been ignoring up to now). {format: png} We’ll remove this text by opening up hero.md within /cloud/project/content/home. {format: png} In this file, set active = false. {format: png} Once the file looks as you see above, you’re ready to save your changes and preview! The blue box with information about widgets will no longer be there! {format: png} We’ll repeat the same process for the demo widget. Open demo.md in /cloud/project/content/home. Set active = false. {format: png} Once you save this file, you can see the changes in your preview. No more extra information at the top of your website! Things are really coming along! {format: png} 4.0.4.2 Skills With those changes, let’s edit the skills section of the website. Navigate to /cloud/project/content/home and open skills.md This is where you highlight all of your job-pertinent skills! Here, we’re suggesting you highlight your “R”, “data visualization”, and “Data Wrangling” skills. But, you could highlight more than three skills or three different skills! Think about what skills you want employers to know you have and include them here. {format: png} To add the three skills you see here, edit the text in the [[feature]] section of the document to include the following: [[feature]] icon = &quot;r-project&quot; icon_pack = &quot;fab&quot; name = &quot;R&quot; description = &quot;&quot; [[feature]] icon = &quot;chart-line&quot; icon_pack = &quot;fas&quot; name = &quot;Data Visualization&quot; description = &quot;&quot; [[feature]] icon = &quot;table&quot; icon_pack = &quot;fas&quot; name = &quot;Data Wrangling&quot; description = &quot;&quot; Note that the text that will be displayed on your website underneath each icon is specified in name. We’ve removed the text from the description variable for each skill, but you could choose to include text here explaining the skill. Then, the icons displayed are specified in icon and icon_pack. Which icon to display on the website is defined in the icon argument and refers to the names of the icons found at Font Awesome Brand, Font Awesome Standard, and Academic Icons. You can search here for other icons you’d like to use to highlight your skills. If you use an icon from Font Awesome Brand, you would then specify fab in the icon_pack variable. From Font Awesome Standard, you’d specify fas. And, from Academic Icons, you’d specify ai. Once these changes are saved, you’ll be able to see the edits on your website preview: {format: png} 4.0.4.3 Removing Content While demonstrating your skills and interests are important on your website, at this point, it’s not important to include all of the sections included by default on this theme. So, at this point, we’re going to go in and turn a bunch of these sections “off.” We won’t delete the content. This way, in the future, if you’re interested in adding any of this information back in, you’ll be able to do so! We’ll remove the “Publications,” “Featured Publications,” “Talks,” “Experience”, “Accomplishments” and “Gallery” sections from your website in this section. The process will be very similar for each. First, navigate to /cloud/project/content/home and open publications.md. In this document, where you see active = true, set that to be active = false. This will remove this section from your homepage. Save these changes. {format: png} In that same directory, open featured.md. Set active = false and save your changes. {format: png} In that same directory, open talks.md. Set active = false and save your changes. {format: png} In that same directory, open experience.md. Set active = false and save your changes. {format: png} In that same directory, open accomplishments.md. Set active = false and save your changes. {format: png} Finally, to turn off Gallery go into cloud/project/content/home/gallery, open index.md. Set active = false and save your changes. {format: png} Now, when you save and preview your website, you can scroll through to see that all these sections will have been removed. Your site will be minimal, but it’s a great place to start! You can always add back in any of these sections later. 4.0.5 Posts We opted not to turn off the posts section of your website. Now, we won’t specify in this lesson what to specifically include in this section, but we will encourage you to write blog posts and include them in this section. For now, we’ll delete the posts that are already in there, since they’re not your blog posts and show you how to write blog posts in the future. {format: png} Navigate to /cloud/project/content/post/getting-started. In this directory, you’ll see a few files. One of them will be index.md If you were to open this file, you’d see all the contents used to write that “Getting Started” post currently on your website. {format: png} While there’s lots of helpful information in this post, you didn’t write it, so you’ll want to delete this directory. The same goes for the jupyter directory. Select both directories and delete the contents. {format: png} Another file in there will be a file with a name similar to: 2015-07-23-r-markdown.Rmd. This will contain the text we included at the beginning of the lesson in the “Edit” box. You can leave this file for now. There will be time to edit and write new posts later! After these changes are saved, your Recent Posts section of your website should look like this: {format: png} The last thing we’ll note is the following. When you are ready to write a blog post, you’ll want to use the “New Post” Add-in. To find this, click on “Addins” in RStudio Cloud. Then select “New Post” from the drop-down menu. {format: png} This will open up a box where you’ll enter the title, author, date, and other information about your post. You can specify whether or not you want this file to be an .Rmd or a Markdown file (if you want it to include R code, choose .Rmd). After entering all the necessary information and clicking “Done,” the Add-in will create the file for you to edit it within the /cloud/project/content/post directory and name it in a consistent manner. This is where you will write your blog post! {format: png} 4.0.6 Projects Aside from including blog posts, you’ll also want to include information on projects you’ve worked on and completed in the projects section. By default, there are two projects included in /cloud/project/content/project. One is in the directory internal-project. The content for this post is included inindex.md. The second is an external-project (meaning the content is hosted elsewhere on the Internet). The content here is again specified in the index.md file within this directory. We’ll remove this content from the site for now, but it’s good to note that it’s possible to include external projects on your site. Delete both directories. {format: png} Now, we’ll create a new project using the “Addins” approach we reviewed previously for creating new posts. Click on “Addins” at the top of RStudio. From the drop-down menu, select “New Post.” In the New Post box that appears, fill out the information as you see here: {format: png} Be sure that “Subdirectory” is project (not post!), and select “project” from the “Archetype” menu. Specify that you want an .Rmd document. Once information is complete, click “Done.” A new file will appear within /cloud/project/content/project and this file will open up. You’ll see that it’s an empty RMarkdown document. It’s up to you to add in the text and code you used to analyze the ATUS Survey data in your final project. {format: png} The skeleton for your project will then be visible on the preview of your website in the Projects section! {format: png} But, what are those tags above your project? We’ll want to customize those as well! To do so, navigate to /cloud/project/content/home and open projects.md. Find the section of this file where you see [[content.filter_button]]. Leave the first filter alone, but edit the second filter to look for the tag “R” in your projects. The last one can be “Other” for now. Use the syntax you see here: {format: png} Note that these tags correspond to the tags specified in the YAML of your post. These filters will search for any projects with the specified tag. You can have more than three tags as you include more projects over time! Once these changes are saved, the new tags will be visible on your preview! {format: png} 4.0.6.1 Website Tailoring Okay, we’ve done a lot, but there’s one last thing we want to do. At this point, it’s more important that future employers see the projects you’ve worked on than the blog posts you’ve written. Thus, we want projects to show up before posts. To do this we’ll edit the weight argument. Return to posts.md within /cloud/project/content/home. Toward the top, change weight = 60 to weight = 65. Save these changes. {format: png} Then, within projects.md within /cloud/project/content/home, change weight = 65 to weight = 60. Save these changes. {format: png} Recent posts will now be displayed after projects on your website: {format: png} 4.0.7 Deployment Your website is now ready for prime time. The only problem is it’s only visible on your RStudio Cloud project. So, we have to deploy your website. There are a number of different ways to do this, but we’re going to use the workflow with which we’re most familiar: GitHub Pages. This is how your website is currently deployed. Your current website is hosted on GitHub at username.github.com and the file structure should look something like what you see here: {format: png} We’re going to delete the current website and replace it with this updated website! To do so, within your current project on RStudio Cloud (where your new blogdown website files are), go to the Terminal and run the following…but replace username with your GitHub username: git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.com.git This will clone your current website repo into the RStudio Cloud project where your new website files are. {format: png} Click on the directory of the repo where your old website contents are. Then, click on More and select “Show Hidden Files” {format: png} Within this directory, you’ll see two hidden files .git and .nojekyll. Do NOT delete these files, but select everything else, and delete the files from your old website. {format: png} Now, we’ll need to add all the new files! But, you should NOT add every file you just generated. You only want to add the contents of /cloud/projects/public. What’s great about blogdown is that every time blogdown::serve_site() runs and generates a new preview of your website, all the files needed to deploy your website are updated and added to /cloud/projects/public. Thus, everything you need to deploy your website is right there. {format: png} Move all the files from /cloud/projects/public to the repository you just cloned (username.github.com) by selecting “Move…” from the “More” drop-down menu. {format: png} All of your new website files should be within the username.github.com directory. {format: png} We’re ready to push these changes to GitHub. To do so, change username in the code below to your GitHub username: cd username.github.com git add -A git commit -m &quot;Rmd to blogdown website&quot; git push In this code, you’re changing your directory to the version controlled directory you just cloned. You’re then staging the files using git add -A, which will stage all new, modified and deleted files. You’re then committing these changes and pushing to GitHub. On GitHub, these changes will all be visible! {format: png} And, when you go to username.github.io, you will be able to see all the changes you’ve made to make your website more professional! Awesome! {format: png} 4.0.8 Additional Resources Blogdown Book, by Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, Alison Presmanes Hill List of blogdown websites JaneEverydayDoe GitHub commit - end of this lesson 4.0.9 Slides and Video Making Your Website More Professional Slides "],["project-gallery.html", "Chapter 5 Project Gallery", " Chapter 5 Project Gallery When looking for a job in data science, it’s best that those interested in hiring you can get a sense for your work easily on the Internet. By displaying projects you’ve worked on on your website, hiring managers can quickly see what skills you have and what you’re interested in. Arguably, this could be seen on GitHub (we’ll get to this in the next lesson!), and hiring managers will likely look there as well; however, by writing up a short report that tells the whole story for a few of your data science projects, (including visualizations!), and including them on your website, you’re making it even easier on hiring managers to see what you can do! In this lesson, we’ll discuss two different ways of displaying your projects on your website, discuss what you’ll want to include on your website, and walk through step-by-step of turning one of the projects in this course into a project included on your website. 5.0.1 Project List The simplest way to display projects on your website is by including bullet points that link to your projects on GitHub; however, looking through multiple folders on your GitHub to figure out what you did on a project is asking a lot of someone. Thus, while it’s better than nothing to include links to your GitHub, you want to make it easier on your readers. To do this, you’ll want to turn your projects into a report or blog post that you’ll then publish on your website. By telling a story about your project, including the results in figures and tables, and making what you did in the analysis very clear, you’re demonstrating both your technical and communication skills all at once. In the last lesson on updating your website, we looked at David Robinson’s “about me” section. In this lesson, we can see that as he carries out projects, he writes blog posts and posts them to his website. {format: png} On his website, his most recent posts are displayed, and the contents of each can be found by clicking on any of the titles. Then, visitors to his site can see the story of his analysis! {format: png} By including links to summaries (blog posts!) of your work on your website, you’re helping individuals looking to learn more about your work or simply interested in your analyses 5.0.2 Project Gallery Beyond providing links to blog posts, it can sometimes be helpful to provide readers with a visual cue as to what will be included in that link. Rather than a list of your projects, including an image along with the title of the post can be very helpful to attracting readers to your work. For example, on Nathan Yau’s site, FlowingData.com, projects can be searched by topic. Then, images for each post are displayed with the title underneath the project and the first few words from the post displayed underneath the title. {format: png} One caveat here is that on this site, Nathan Yau often links to others’ work to promote and support their work, so these aren’t all his own projects. On your website, when looking for a job, you would want to be sure to include links to your work primarily. You can then use Twitter (we’ll talk about this later!) to support and promote others’ work, at least while you’re looking for a job. Once you’re more established (like Nathan Yau), it’s OK to include links to others’ work on your website, as long as you give them credit, of course! Another great example of a project gallery can be seen on Mona Chalabi’s website. We saw her about me section in the last lesson and learned that she visualizes data using creative and artistic drawings/visualizations. This type of work perfectly lends itself to a project gallery, as the visualizations are the story. {format: png} However, Mona is also a writer. Her journalism pieces are also listed on her website, in list format! Both project lists and project galleries can be effective ways to share your work on your website! {format: png} 5.0.3 What To Include As you’re preparing your project gallery, you’ll want links to a few blog posts about projects you’ve worked on. These posts should display your ability to: find a dataset wrangle a dataset explore a dataset analyze a dataset visualize a dataset tell a story effective data science communication You’ll want at least a few examples of your work, meaning at least 3 different projects you’ve worked on. And, you’ll want to make sure at least one of these is a project you’ve come up with and worked on on your own – you don’t want the projects you display to all come from the projects done in this Course Set, although some of them can be! 5.0.4 What Not To Include As you’re looking for a job, it’s best to avoid criticizing the work of others in your project gallery. You can certainly use a dataset that someone else has written about previously to do your own analysis; however, your post should not tear apart what that other individual did in theirs. Additionally, remember this is a blog post. (For details about what to include in a blog post, refer back to the Written and Oral Communication in Data Science course.) This post should tell a story and include details about your analysis, but it shouldn’t include every detail about your analysis. You should do the analysis and then pare down what you have to only what’s necessary to communicate your story to your audience. Finally, remember that this should demonstrate your skills and abilities. Do not take code or work from others without properly citing those individuals. Giving attribution to others’ work when deserved is incredibly important. Be sure that all writing and code portrayed are your own in your project gallery actually are your own work. 5.0.5 Your Final Project Now that we’ve seen a few examples of others’ projects, let’s get down to preparing one project you may want to include in your project gallery! In the last course, one of the quiz questions required you to create a presentation on Google Slides taking what you did in your Final project and turning it into a presentation that you’d present to a technical audience. Thus, you should have already thought a bit about how you would tell a story about this analysis. We’ll use that same project (your Final Project from Data Analysis) here, but instead of generating a Google Slides presentation, we’ll turn this project into a project that you will include on your website! The link to this page on your website will be required in the quiz for this lesson, so it’s best to follow along, create this post, and update your website as you work through this lesson! 5.0.5.1 New Post Setup In the last lesson, we set up the skeleton for a project on your website, but we didn’t include any content in that project at that time. The goal of this lesson is to fill out that section of your website a little more! We’ll start by adding your Final Project analyzing the American Time Use Survey Data for this Course Set as a project on your website here. {format: png} This write up should take what you did in your final project and turn it into a detailed but clear blog post format for inclusion on your website. To get started, return to the project on RStudio Cloud for your blogdown website. Navigate in the Files tab to /cloud/project/content/project. In here you’ll see the atus-survey.md file we created in the last lesson. {format: png} But, at this point, if you want to take what you did in your final project and turn it into a blog post, you probably want an R Markdown (.Rmd) file, not a Markdown (.md) file. That’s ok! We’ll walk through how to create a new post now! First, make sure that you are in /cloud/project and not your version controlled website directory before attempting to make a new post. Then, click on the “Addins” button on the menu along the top. Select “New post” from the drop-down menu. {format: png} In the pop-up “New Post” box that appear, enter the “Title” of your final project. For this lesson, we’ve titled this post “ATUS Survey Data”, but as we’ve discussed in previous lessons, this is not a very good title. A better title would concisely convey the findings of the analysis. Be sure that your project title is better than “ATUS Survey Data.” After deciding on a good title, include your name in the “Author” box and today’s Date in the “Date” box. Then, importantly change Subdirectory to project. This ensures that the new post goes in your project directory and not your post directory. After that, you can choose a few Categories and Tags to include on your website. Leave “Archetype” as is. The name of the file and the slug will fill in automatically. Leave those defaults alone. Finally **change the format to “R Markdown (.Rmd)”. {format: png} This will generate an R Markdown document where you’ll be able to get started! Once this information is all complete, click “Done” {format: png} 5.0.5.2 Project Content With the file ready, we’ll need to determine the general framework for this blog post. This means determining what sections to include in the project and what figures/results you’ll present to tell your story. It’s a good idea to place possible section headers in the document before you start adding content. A general framework for this project and most analyses blog posts could be the following: {format: png} You could choose to use this framework or modify it to best tell the story of your analysis. But, regardless of what sections you include, you want to be sure to explain why you’re doing the analysis and what question you’ll be answering in this post in the introduction. Following this, it’s often a good idea to explain where the data came from and display the code you used to get the data into RStudio Cloud. The Exploratory Data Analysis section should explain how you wrangled the data and maybe show an explanatory plot or two. How you analyzed the data should be explained briefly after the data are explained. The Results section is the most important - this should summarize your findings, including figures and tables to guide the reader and help them understand your results. The sub-headers within the results section should tell the reader what your results were. Finally, a conclusion should pull everything together. Within your R Markdown document, this framework would be entered as follows: {format: png} Before we get to adding content, a reminder that you can run blogdown::serve_site() at any point in time to preview the changes to your site that you’ve made. After saving those changes to the R Markdown file, the homepage would look as follows. {format: png} If you were to click on this post, you would be able to preview the skeleton of your project that you just made! {format: png} We’ll get to filling in the content for the actual post; however, let’s take a step back to make the project on the homepage look more like the skeleton post we created before. We want to add a picture to the preview on the homepage, include a caption on the homepage post, and include a picture on the post itself. These changes will all be made in the YAML at the top of your R Markdown document. {format: png} summary: &#39;Analysis of 2016 American Time Use Survey (ATUS) Data&#39; image_preview: &#39;bubbles.jpg&#39; header: image: &#39;bubbles.jpg&#39; We’ll explain the YAML edits here: * summary: the caption text on the post on your homepage * image_preview: the image included with your post on your homepage * header: image: the image included in the header of your project post itself. There are a number of other appearance edits you can make in the YAML of your R Markdown document, but these are all we’ll cover for now. We’re including the default bubbles.jpg image for now, but for each project you should change this to an image that makes sense for that project. The image you want to include should be stored in /cloud/project/static/img. {format: png} Now when you preview your projects on your homepage, the project looks just like the skeleton post we created previously! {format: png} At this point, we can delete the atus-survey.md project file because we’re going to include just the .Rmd file on our website. {format: png} 5.0.5.3 Content With the skeleton for your post in your R Markdown document ready and the appearance on your website ready to go, it’s time to include text and code throughout the post. For example, in the data section you’d explain where the data came from, describe how many observations are in the data and what variables you’re most interested in. {format: png} You’d also include a code chunk that would read the data into R. Note that you’ll likely want to include the data in the project website directory (/cloud/project/content/project). You can create subdirectories within this directory (for example: /cloud/project/content/project/atus_survey) to help keep things organized. If we were to save and preview this file at this point on your website, it would be pretty bare bones, but you would be able to see all the changes you’ve made. Note that you do NOT have to Knit this file, as you would normally. blogdown does that automatically for you when you preview the site! {format: png} And, as you include more content for what you did in this analysis, it will become a full-fledged post. Be sure that there is text accompanying all code, figures and table, to explain to your readers what is being done throughout the project. Adapt the text and code from your projects into this document by using the code you’ve already written but adding text to explain to a reader what you’ve done. You can copy sentences and code chunks, but do not simply copy everything currently in your project .Rmd document because there is a lot of explanatory text explaining to you what to do in the project. The goal of this post is to tell a story about your analysis. Make sure all text included in this document and every code chunk helps tell that story. Before finishing change the picture included in the header and on your homepage preview to something that matches the project. It could be a figure included in your analysis or a photo of yours (or that is freely-available) that has something to do with your analysis. Make sure that this photo is uploaded into /cloud/project/static/img 5.0.5.4 Proofread After you’re happy with your post, it’s always a good idea to proofread your writing for typos and errors. 5.0.6 Push to GitHub Once you’re happy with these changes, remember that in order for them to be seen on your website, all the contents of your /cloud/project/public/ directory have to be added to your website directory. To do this, first delete all of the current files (except for the hidden files!) in /cloud/project/username.github.com. {format: png} Then, select all the files in cloud/project/public. Click “More” and select “Move” from the drop down menu. {format: png} Select the Folder for your website in the pop-up “Choose Folder” window. Click “Choose.” {format: png} You’re now ready to push all your changes to GitHub. Make sure you’re in the correct version-controlled directory (/cloud/project/username.github.com/) and then add, commit, and push your changes: cd /cloud/project/username.github.com/ git add . git commit -m &quot;add projects tab&quot; git push Your changes will now be viewable on your website! {format: png} You’ll also want to create projects or posts for your Data Tidying and Data Visualization Projects on your website. That won’t be required of this lesson, but it is a good idea to make sure that your work is represented clearly on your website 5.0.7 Your Own Project So far in this Course set, you’ve been told what data to work with, how to explore it, and what questions to answer. However, when looking for a job, hiring managers will want to see that you have completed projects on your own. At this point, it’s your job to use all the skills you’ve learned throughout this Course Set to add a project that is all your own to your website. To be considered complete, this project must demonstrate your ability to: form a data science question get data tidy data explore data analyze data visualize data communicate your analysis effectively Carry out a data science project on your own about a topic you care about or find interesting! Then add this project to your blogdown website. Push the changes to GitHub and include the link to your project in the quiz below. 5.0.8 Slides and Video Project Gallery Slides "],["improving-your-github-profile.html", "Chapter 6 Improving Your GitHub Profile", " Chapter 6 Improving Your GitHub Profile After discussing the required application materials, such as a resume and cover letter, and your personal website and the projects you’ve worked on, the next step in getting ready to apply to jobs is to be sure that your professional social media presence is complete and up-to-date. While this may not be a requirement of a job application, it is likely that your social media presence will be looked at during the interview process. Thus, while not required, it is incredibly important. In this and the following few lessons in this course, we’ll walk through the necessary steps to get each of your professional social media platforms up-to-date. In this lesson, our focus will be on ensuring your GitHub presence and profile is ready for the job market. 6.0.1 Profile For each profile, it’s a good idea to include a picture of yourself along with your profile. This does not have to be a glamour shot or professional photo, but it will ideally be a photo of you (without anyone else in the photo) with a simple and ideally solid color background. In fact, the same photo can be used across platforms. For example, if you have a photo on GitHub, it can be helpful to use that same photo on LinkedIn and Twitter, so that people can be sure that the accounts all belong to the same individual - you! Note that if you are not comfortable sharing an image of yourself on the Internet, it can be helpful to add some recognizable image to each of your social media accounts for the aforementioned reason. This could be a picture you’ve taken of a location or of your pet, or something of that nature. You’ll also want to add a brief description to your GitHub profile and a link to your website. To make all of these changes to your GitHub profile, first login to GitHub. Helpfully, if you haven’t completed your profile yet, GitHub will likely prompt you to add profile information. Below, your username on GitHub, you’ll want to first click, “Edit profile.” {format: png} You’ll want to fill in all the following fields with accurate information: {format: png} Name - at least your first name. Include your last name too if you’re comfortable doing so. Bio - a brief bio about your interests and skills URL - the link to your website You can additionally include a public email address, a Company, and your Location, if you’re comfortable doing so. Know that this information will be shared with GitHub and anyone who looks at your GitHub page. This information can be updated or deleted at any point in time. Once you’ve filled in these fields, click on “Upload new picture” at the right-hand side of the screen. Using the window that pops up, navigate to the location of the photo you’d like to use as your profile picture and click “Open.” Adjust the box to position and crop the photo as you desire and click “Set new profile picture.” The new picture will appear on your Public Profile. {format: png} Once you’ve filled in the necessary information and added the photo you’d like to use, click “Update profile.” Your profile will now be up to date! To see an example of a complete GitHub profile, we’ll take a look at Jenny Bryan’s GitHub: {format: png} Helpfully, Jenny Bryan has included a picture, her name, a brief bio that let’s us know where she works, a link to her website, and her location. She’s also specified six pinned repositories. 6.0.2 Pinned Repos In addition to updating your personal information, you also have the opportunity to choose which repositories are displayed on your personal GitHub page. GitHub will choose six repos to display; however, you can customize which repos are shown here by clicking “Customize your pinned repositories.” {format: png} A new box will appear and you’ll have the opportunity to select six repos to remain pinned on your GitHub profile. You’ll want to have the six projects your most proud, that are the most interesting, or that demonstrate your skills best appear. Once you’ve checked six boxes, click “Save pinned repositories.” {format: png} These repos will now be displayed on your profile. {format: png} 6.0.3 GitHub Contributions When applying to jobs, future co-workers and hiring mangers will almost certainly take a look at your GitHub to get a sense for your programming skills. Additionally, they will also often look to see what type of community member you are. Data scientists are often members of teams, and this means that hiring managers will look for individuals who work well with and are willing to help others. One way to demonstrate this ability is by contributing to others work on GitHub. To get started being a good community member, there are two ways to contribute early on: submitting PRs (pull requests) that fix typos submitting PRs that address issues on others’ repos 6.0.3.1 Fixing Typos Unlike sending an email letting the developer know about a typo and the developer then having to go in and make the edit themselves, the great thing about pull requests on GitHub is that you do the work (fix the typo) and then the developer (the person whose GitHub repo it is) simply has to accept the pull request for the changes to be made. The amount of work on the developer is minimal, but your contribution is important and helps the community by making documentation clearer! Thus, if you see a typo in someone else’s documentation or README file, feel free to edit the typo and submit a pull request! 6.0.3.2 Addressing GitHub Issues Further, for R packages that are hosted on GitHub, there are often many issues that users and other developers submit to the repository. It can be a lot on developers to keep up with these issues. Fortunately, you can take a look at the issues on packages you use to see if there are any issues you can help with. If you figure out how to address the issue, you can again submit a PR to the developers and they can determine if they want to accept your PR. Specifically, many packages also include tags within issues stating where they feel help is wanted on an issue (using the tag “help wanted”) or where developers feel there’s an opportunity for individuals with less experience to contribute (using the tag “good first issue”). {format: png} For example, let’s take a look at ggplot2. On the day this lesson was written, there were 91 open issues. If you were to click on the “good first issue” tag at the top of this page, GitHub would filter to include issues that were specified to be “good first issues” for less experienced developers. You could look through these issues and see if you could contribute. If you could, you could submit a PR to the developers! {format: png} Note that addressing issues on GitHub is not required. You should not accept unhelpful pull requests just for the sake of submitting pull requests. Only submit a pull request that solves an issue. In fact, ggplot2 and many other packages have contributing guidelines to help define when and how to best make a contribution to the package’s development. Read these guidelines now to get a sense of when it’s best and how to make a contribution to someone else’s package. 6.0.3.3 StackOverflow Finally, answering others’ question on StackOverflow in a helpful manner is a good way to help the R community. While some hiring managers may not look there, others do. Thus, it’s always good to have a reputation as a team player online. Again, only answer questions where you actually answer the other individual’s question in a helpful, complete, and kind manner. Your reputation on this platform will be assessed by hiring managers and you never want to look like a jerk. 6.0.4 Summary In this lesson we discussed the importance of having a complete GitHub profile and how to be a helpful and productive community member online by fixing typos on others’ repositories, addressing GitHub issues, and answering questions on StackOverflow. 6.0.5 Additional Resources You Do Not Need to Tell Me I Have a Typo in My Documentation, by Yihui Xie Contributing to ggplot2 development 6.0.6 Slides and Video Improving Your GitHub Profile Slides "],["improving-your-linkedin-profile.html", "Chapter 7 Improving Your LinkedIn Profile", " Chapter 7 Improving Your LinkedIn Profile Having a LinkedIn profile is important because it allows recruiters and those responsible for hiring to find you. Recruiters who pay to use LinkedIn can search by terms (such as “data scientist” or “R programmer”) and will be able to identify you as a possible job candidate! Additionally, based on your profile, LinkedIn will be able to suggest possible jobs that may be of interest given the information you’ve provided! That said, it’s best to think of your LinkedIn Profile as a more-detailed resume. Thus, every job and skill that is mentioned on your resume should also be on your LinkedIn Profile. However, on your LinkedIn profile, relative to your resume, the amount of information you can include about each position and the projects you completed at each place can include more detail. You should have created a LinkedIn profile in the first course in this Course Set; however, if you haven’t you’ll need to do that before carrying on with this lesson. Similar to your GitHub profile, it’s important to include a professional-looking picture of yourself on your profile (the same one as your GitHub profile works!), contact information, a link to your website, a brief bio, and details about your experience, education, and skills on LinkedIn. We’ll walk through the steps to update your LinkedIn profile in this lesson. 7.0.1 LinkedIn Profile Once you log in to LinkedIn using the account we previously created (in a lesson in an earlier lesson), you’ll be ready to improve upon your current profile. We didn’t previously fill in any information, so there will be a lot to do here! Note that you may be asked after logging in, “What are you most interested in?” Feel free to click on finding a job at a later point in time. However, for now, we’ll click “Not now” to continue on updating our profile. {format: png} Navigate to your profile, using the icon at the top right-hand of the screen {format: png} 7.0.1.1 Picture The first thing we’ll do is update the profile picture on your page. To do so, click on the camera icon. {format: png} Navigate to where the picture you’ve used for your website and GitHub are located on your computer and click “Open.” A Screen will appear with your photo in it. Adjust the size and position of the circle to best capture you in the photo you’ve uploaded. You have the option to zoom, straighten, adjust the brightness, crop, filter, and adjust this photo. Additionally, you can control who sees this photo by clicking on the “Visibility” icon. Once you’re happy with your profile picture, click “Apply.” {format: png} 7.0.1.2 Biography After uploading your photo, you’ll be brought to a new screen asking you to Edit your intro. This is the information that individuals will first see when they come to your LinkedIn Page. {format: png} Ensure that your First and Last Name are correct. Then, include a Headline. This should very briefly explain your professional skills and interests. For example, Renee Teate, a data scientist, uses the headline “Creative data scientist with strong communication skills” and then lists a number of her strengths underneath that headlines. This quickly gives you an idea of what her strengths and interests are, which is great! {format: png} Be sure that your headline quickly, concisely, and accurately represents your skillset as a data scientist and enter it into the “Headline Box.” Once you’ve updated your photo and Headline, click “Save.” {format: png} You’ll now have the opportunity to update more information about yourself. Be sure that the “Country/Region is correct.” Add a ZIP code if you’re comfortable doing so (this is not required). Then, choose an industry that best matches your skill set from the drop-down menu. “Computer Software” may be the best-fit, depending on your interests and background. {format: png} Finally, include a longer Summary about your interests and skills. This should concisely describe to recruiters what you know and what you’re interested in doing as a data scientist! 7.0.1.3 Links Out On this same screen, you’ll want to be sure to include links to your other professional sites. To do so, click on the pencil icon to the right of the “Contact Info” line. {format: png} On this new screen, no information is required; however, you’ll want to click on “Add website”. {format: png} Add the URL to your professional website here. Then, click “Apply.” {format: png} This will bring you back to the “Edit intro” screen. {format: png} We’ll click “Save” on this screen to see the changes to our profile before moving on to include even more information. {format: png} Your headline and photo will now be visible on your profile. And, if you click “See contact info”, your website will now be there. 7.0.1.4 Education, Experience, and Skills Now that you have a few updates, we’ll discuss what other information should be included on your LinkedIn profile. You’ll definitely want to update your profile to include information about your education, experience, and skills. The information included in these sections should largely recapitulate your resume; however, more detail can be included for each entry on LinkedIn than would be included on your resume. That said, keep it reasonable – humans have short attention spans. Be sure that any information you’re putting down is important or would be important to a potential employer. Better to be short and clear than long and rambling. We’ll return again to Renee Teate’s profile. Her experience entry for her current position as a data scientist at HelioCampus includes her job title, when she started the position, where she works, and what her responsibilities in this job are. {format: png} To fill out your job experience, click on “Add profile section” and click on “Work experience” from the drop-down menu. {format: png} Fill out the information on the “Add experience” window and then click “Save.” As you fill out any experience, be sure to include all relevant jobs and experience you have. {format: png} You’ll want to use the same process to update your educational attainments. Click on “Add profile section” but select “Education” this time from the drop-down menu. {format: png} Enter your information into the “Add education” menu. Once complete, click Save. {format: png} Finally, you’ll want to include skills you have so that others looking for these skills will be able to find you. Click on the “Add profile section” menu and select skills from the drop-down menu. {format: png} Select the skills you have. As you select them, they will show up with check marks below the search bar. Once you’ve added all relevant skills, click “Add” to add them to your profile. {format: png} Feel free to work through and include more information on your LinkedIn (Volunteer work, Accomplishments, Courses, Certificates, etc.) The more information you provide, the more helpful your profile will become! However, at the bare minimum, be sure you have listed your Educational background, your Experience, and your Skills. 7.0.2 Connecting to Others Networking is an important concept on LinkedIn. By connecting to others in your field, you start to generate a professional network. And, while there is debate about with whom you should connect on LinkedIn, with some people arguing connect to as many people as possible and others saying only to connect with those you know, we’ll argue here that you should start off by only linking with others you know. Maybe you’ve chatted with someone on Twitter or met someone at a conference - these are people to connect with at the beginning. Over time you can then decide how wide you want to cast your LinkedIn net. To connect with someone, search for their name in the search bar. Here, we’ve searched for Jeff Leek, one of the authors of this course. To connect with him, you would click on the “Connect” button to the right of his name. {format: png} An invitation to connect with Jeff Leek will be sent to him to verify. Once he verifies the connection, you will be connected on LinkedIn. Click “Done” on the pop-up box. LinkedIn will also suggest people you may know. If you have some professional relationship with them at this point, feel free to Connect with them. Hold off on connecting with everyone you see here until you have a better understanding of how LinkedIn will work best for you. 7.0.3 Summary In this lesson we’ve discussed how to use LinkedIn to expand your professional network, improve your online presence, provide information that’s on your resume online, and enable you to be searched by hiring managers and recruiters. It’s essential to keep this up-to-date overtime, especially whenever you’re looking for a job. 7.0.4 Additional Resources LinkedIn Data on Data Scientists Renee Teate’s LinkedIn 7.0.5 Slides and Video Improving Your LinkedIn Profile Slides "],["using-twitter-for-data-science.html", "Chapter 8 Using Twitter For Data Science", " Chapter 8 Using Twitter For Data Science In a lesson in an earlier course we had you create a professional Twitter account. This is because Twitter is a very active place among data scientists. As a result, Twitter can be a great place to learn about new topics and to meet others in you field. Additionally, people often tweet about open positions at their companies, so Twitter can be a really great place both when you’re looking to learn more and improve your skills and when you’re looking for a job! In this lesson we’ll briefly discuss customizing your Twitter profile and then spend a fair amount of time delving into how to use Twitter effectively as a data scientist. 8.0.1 Profile As with every other platform we’ve discussed so far, you’ll want to add a photo and update your Twitter profile. Your Twitter profile will contain less information than the other profiles we’ve discussed thus far, so we’ll discuss all necessary steps of how to do so right away. To update your photo, log into your Twitter account. If you haven’t yet uploaded a photo, you can do so, by clicking on the camera icon and clicking on “Upload photo” from the drop-down menu. {format: png} Navigate to the file you want to upload on your computer. In the window that appears, position and size your photo. When you’re satisfied, click “Apply.” {format: png} From here, click on the menu at the top right-hand of the screen and click “Profile” to navigate to your Twitter Profile. {format: png} Here, at the right, you can click on “Edit profile.” {format: png} This will open up a box where you can write a short bio about yourself. This should just be a few words about your interests! Here, we’ve included a few Twitter bios as examples. (BecomingDataSci?)(https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSci?lang=en) is the Twitter account for the same person whose LinkedIn profile we looked at in the LinkedIn lesson. The other two are from two of the authors of this course. You’ll note that they aren’t very long and just briefly describe the Twitter user. Note that these can be edited at any time and will change over time. {format: png} You’ll also want to include a link to your personal website in the “Website” box. Type the URL of your website there. On these same three profiles whose bios we just looked at, you’ll see that each has also helpfully provided their website URL within their individual Twitter profiles. {format: png} If you want to share your location, you can also include that under “Location,” but this is not required. Once you’ve completed all the information you’d like your profile to include, click “Save changes” on the right-hand side. {format: png} 8.0.2 Who &amp; What To Follow Once you’ve got an updated profile, you’re ready to start following people. It’s best to keep this Twitter account as professional as possible. So, you may not want to follow your personal friends, musicians, actors, or other celebrities on this account. Rather, it’s best to follow those who post information that will be helpful to you as a data scientist. Unlike LinkedIn where it may be best to limit who you follow right off the bat, it’s ok to follow people you don’t yet know on Twitter. Your goal should be to follow people you think 1) are interesting, 2) can teach you something, and/or 3) may post about things that would help you in your career! As you search for individuals to follow, you come across someone you think you’d like to hear from, you should click the “Follow” button on their profile. {format: png} While you are not required to follow anyone, as someone new to the field of data science and who uses R, we’re providing a list of people you may want to follow: {format: png} It can also be helpful to look through who these people follow to find other people you may be interested in following. Finally, you can also search for people to follow using common hashtags, such as #rstats or #r4ds. These two will put you in contact with a crowd that codes primarily in R. However, #datascience and #dataviz will connect you with individuals interested in data science and data visualization generally. You can follow and unfollow people as you find helpful, so you aren’t locked into following anyone forever. 8.0.3 Tweeting After you decide on who to follow, you’ll want to check Twitter every so often to see what everyone has to say – this can be a really great way to keep up with the newest data science news and to learn a lot! As you begin to follow along and generate your own tweets, there are a few general guidelines that will make your Twitter experience a positive one: keep it positive avoid fights support others It’s incredibly easy to allow discussions on the Internet to take a negative turn. But, avoid that instinct. Keep what you put on Twitter positive and avoid delving into Twitter feuds. Disagreements happen, but you should never make personal attacks or be unkind or rude to others on Twitter, regardless of what they do. Also, Twitter can be an amazing and supportive place. So, try to promote your own work and support the work of others from your account. We’ll discuss the details of this below! 8.0.3.1 Tweeting for Self-Promotion When tweeting from your professional account, it is a great idea to tweet about work that you’ve done! Tweet about your projects, cool findings, or awesome visualizations. Include pictures of your awesome graphs, images from your blog post, and links to your work! When possible, include images that are compelling. These can help people visually remember your work! One example of this is shown here. Jeff Leek wrote a book about How to be a Modern Scientist. This book includes information about how to use Twitter as a professional, so feel free to check it out for more details. But, as for the tweet, Jeff included an image, linked to where the content is, and stated that he released the book. What a great and informative tweet about his work! {format: png} 8.0.3.2 Tweeting to Promote Others You don’t need your own, original content to build up a following on Twitter. Twitter can be a great place to promote others’ work. You can gain followers by promoting others, being funny, being interesting, and curating others work effectively. By tweeting about others’ work, you’ll have a record of all the things you find interesting, will be able to be a good community member (by promoting others’ work), and will be able to add your thoughts about their work. Twitter is great b/c you can share others’ work by adding your own commentary in your tweet! In your tweet, you should always always cite the individual and link to their work. For example, here we see a case where Jeff tweets about a talk that (CMU_Stats?)(https://twitter.com/CMU_Stats) was giving at a conference. He explains what was being discussed, includes (CMU_Stats?)(https://twitter.com/CMU_Stats)’ Twitter handle, and includes a picture! {format: png} Additionally, Jeff uses the hashtag #JSM2018. This allows individuals following this hashtag on Twitter to easily find the tweet. Using helpful hashtags are another great way for others to find your twitter and follow you, even when they don’t know you personally! 8.0.3.3 How To Tweet When you’re ready to start tweeting, you’ll want to click the blue “Tweet” button from your profile. {format: png} In the box that appears, you’ll compose your tweet. You can add emojis, photos, GIFs, polls, and location to your tweets. The character limit on tweets is now 280 characters. This limit forces you to ensure your tweets are concise. It’s good practice to convey a message clearly in a few short words. {format: png} As you generate tweets, you may have individuals comment on your tweets. Twitter can be a great place for quick discussions! However, here, we’ll leave you with a reminder to keep your tweets professional from this account. Use your data science Twitter account as a professional social media account, which means that you never want to tweet anything inappropriate, rude, or unprofessional. 8.0.4 Summary In this lesson we discussed why Twitter can be a great place to learn more about data science quickly, how to use the platform to grow your network while having a positive experience, how to tweet for self-promotion, and how to tweet about others’ work. 8.0.5 Additional Resources How to be a modern scientist, by Jeff Leek Phrasing: Communicating data science through tweets, gifs, and classic misdirection video, by [Mara Averick] 8.0.6 Slides and Video Using Twitter For Data Science Slides "],["data-science-job-descriptions.html", "Chapter 9 Data Science Job Descriptions", " Chapter 9 Data Science Job Descriptions In this lesson we’ll discuss what data scientists do, what skills companies expect entry-level data scientists to have, and walk through a few data scientist job descriptions. 9.0.1 What Data Scientists Do Very generally, it’s expected that data scientists know how to interpret and extract meaning from data. But, in practice, what does this actually mean? Well, at a company that sells a product on the Internet, it could the job of a data scientist to figure out what changes to the website caused increases in sales. Or at a company that hires many individuals it could be a data scientist’s job to determine what characteristics of their best hire shave ultimately lead to the biggest increase in revenue for that company. In fact, at Airbnb, they have three different tracks for data scientists to cater to individuals’ strengths and the company’s needs. While the problems differ from one company to the next regardless of location, data scientists work with data to solve problems. 9.0.2 Skills for entry-level positions We’ll look at examples of job descriptions for data scientist positions below; however, before we get there, we’ll discuss the three general categories of skills that entry-level applicants are expected to have. Note that having all of these skills would be ideal, but not every candidate will be an expert in each and every one. So, on your application, play up your strengths and in your free time be sure to improve upon the skills where you’re less-expert to make your application even stronger over time! Companies are looking for data scientists to have strong technical skills, that will be good employees, and who have business skills. We’ll walk through what skills fall under each of these categories in this section, but if you’re interested to see others’ thoughts on this, feel free to check out this thread on Quora. 9.0.2.1 Technical Skills No data scientist will be hired without technical skills. Thus, it’s important to be technically skilled before applying for jobs. The most-common required skills are the following: Basic Programming Languages : R, Python, and SQL are three of the most common programming languages used by data scientists. Data Wrangling : Data Scientists spend a great deal of time getting data into a usable format, cleaning the data, and ensuring that the data they have are the data they need. This skill is essential for all data scientists. Data Visualization : Visualizing data effectively for communication is an important skill for data scientists. Statistics : Having a basic understanding of statistics is often expected of data scientists Machine Learning : Machine Learning is frequently used for predictive analyses. Having a basic understanding of machine learning and familiarizing yourself with various approaches will help you get a job. To demonstrate that you have these technical skills, you’ll want to include them on your resume. However, you should not list every machine learning algorithm you’ve ever heard of. Anyone can Google and list a bunch of algorithms. Instead, simply include “machine learning” as a skill on your resume if it’s one you possess. Then, let your projects and experience do the explaining. By this we mean, the projects you’ve worked on and experience you’ve listed on your resume should demonstrate how you’ve used machine learning to solve a problem. Additionally, having a Project Gallery and GitHub here are critical. The company can go to your GitHub and/or website to see how you’ve applied your technical skills to answer interesting questions. 9.0.2.2 Work Principles In addition to technical skills, companies will be looking for data scientists who will make good employees. Thus, there are a number of work principles that hiring managers will be looking for. Good data scientists are dedicated to their work and determined to succeed. No company wants to hire someone, train them, and then lose them right away. As such, companies will be looking for individuals who are dedicated to their job. Good employees are also dependable. The company must be able to count on you showing up and completing assigned projects. Finally, data scientists in particular are always learning. Technologies change. Data Formats are altered. New approaches are developed. Thus, data scientists must demonstrate that they are able to learn new things and are adaptable. Being set in one’s ways is not really an option for a data scientist, as the field is always changing and constantly moving forward. It makes for an exciting job, but is not for individuals who struggle to adapt. These principles should not just be listed on your resume. Again, anyone can write these words in a list. Rather, these qualities should be demonstrated on your resume through your experience and come through in the stories you tell in your cover letter. Examples are the way to demonstrate that you’ll be a good employee. 9.0.2.3 Business Skills Finally, data scientists very rarely work in isolation. Instead, they’re part of a team. This means that as a data scientist you’ll likely be working with other data scientists and other individuals at the company. Thus, it’s incredibly important that data scientists possess a number of business skills: effective communicators problem solvers knowledgeable curious &amp; interested It’s expected that data scientists be able to talk with others to help hone the question that they’re trying to ask and to effectively communicate the results of their analyses. Similarly, to do the job of a data scientist, it requires one to solve problems in creative and new ways. Being a problem solver who is knowledgeable about how to work with data and the data the company has is an important skill. Finally, it will be expected that you’re curious to learn more and interested in what you’re doing. These qualities can also come through on your resume, website, and cover letter through examples. Additionally, in an interview (which we’ll discuss in a later lesson), it’s important that those interviewing you see that you possess these qualities. {format: png} 9.0.3 Job Descriptions Now that we’ve discussed the general qualities and skills expected of data scientists, let’s get down to actually discussing what you’ll see in data science job descriptions. 9.0.3.1 General Job Description In the following lesson, we’ll discuss where to find open jobs, but for now we’ll just make sure we’re all on the same page about what you will generally find in job descriptions! Typically, a job description will have a few components: Logo - the company’s logo will typically be at the top of the job description Job Title - the job title of the open position Location - where this job is located Introduction - Brief introduction to the company and position Job Description - this section will describe the responsibilities of the posted position as well as some specifics on the required and expected skills a successful applicant would possess Job Qualifications - this section will bullet point out the educational, knowledge, abilities, skills, and experience requirements they’re looking for in the individual who fills this position Preferred Qualifications - Sometimes, a company will choose to include some optional skills or abilities they’d like from a candidate, but that aren’t required. {format: png} Now that we have a general understanding of what information is included in a job description, let’s walk through five actual job postings from Airbnb, Claire’s, and Allstate to see what information each company is looking for in a “Data Scientist” 9.0.3.2 Data Science at Airbnb At Airbnb, there are three tracks for data science positions. The Analytics Track, the Algorithms Track, and the Inference Track. Very briefly here, data scientists on the: analytics track focus on monitoring metrics of the company, building tools, and helping the company make data-driven decisions. algorithms track are responsible for building and interpreting algorithms that will help to power data products at the company inference track use statistical techniques to determine causal relationships For each of these three categories, we’ll first walk through a job description from Airbnb. We’ll break the description down by what technical, employee, and business skills they company is looking for in each position. After the Airbnb examples, we’ll walk through two more examples of a data science job descriptions from other companies and do the same. This way, you’ll have a fairly complete picture of what job descriptions look like and what skills companies are looking for from their data scientists. The way we’ll break down each post is by first highlighting what technical skills the company is looking for in green. We’ll then highlight the type of employee they’re looking for in purple. Finally, we’ll highlight the business skills they’re seeking in orange. 9.0.3.3 Airbnb: Analytics At Airbnb, data scientists on the analytics team have a number of responsibilities and are particularly skilled at asking really good questions, automating analyses and visualizing data. Data scientists at Airbnb on the analytics team are responsible for providing the company with recommendations that drive changes to how things at Airbnb are done. Here we have an excerpt from a job posting at Airbnb for a data science - analytics position: {format: png} As mentioned earlier, data scientist positions will always require technical skills of the applicant. In this job posting we see a number of technical skill requirements, including programming, statistics, and data visualization skills. {format: png} Additionally, Airbnb expects that the individuals they hire will be good employees. As such, they have to take ownership of their work, be able to strategize with others, and be open to learning new things. {format: png} Finally, there are a number of business skills that a data scientist must possess. In this job description we see that Airbnb’s data science analytics team really prioritizes the ability to communicate their findings effectively. {format: png} 9.0.3.4 Airbnb: Algorithms Data scientists on the algorithms track are responsible for understanding and working with different types of data, developing machine learning algorithms, and both producing and managing data products to help the company’s users’ experiences. In their job description they explain a bit about the position and then include a number of sample projects to give prospective applicants the type of work they would do in this position as well as list a number of qualifications of the position. Among these are a number of technical skills. For this position, applicants are expected to have a deep understanding of machine learning, statistics, and programming at scale. The strongest candidates will also have experience in natural language processing (NLP). {format: png} This particular job description explicitly states fewer work principles than the analyst job description, but does state that the ideal candidates will be team players and open to leadership roles. That said, while not explicitly stated, it’s still implied that anyone they hire will be dedicated, dependable, and interested in their work. {format: png} Finally, the successful applicant will be able to take a project, manage it, and move it from start to finish. This is an important quality and expected skill of data scientist on the algorithm track at Airbnb. {format: png} 9.0.3.5 Airbnb: Inference Data scientists on the inference track are responsible for generating hypotheses, carrying out experiments that will help determine causality, and refine strategies to drive decisions within the company. For this position (as with the last two positions), the job description states a number of desired technical skills, including programming, data wrangling and statistical knowledge. {format: png} Additionally, this job description states that successful applicants will be focused, detail-oriented, team players who are passionate about their work. {format: png} Finally, the job description explicitly states that written and verbal communication skills are valued for individuals in this position. {format: png} 9.0.3.6 Airbnb job descriptions Across all three job descriptions, there are technical skills, work principles, and business skills stated directly in the job description. While the technical skills vary from one position to the next, the expectations of good employees, and business skills expected from employees overlap a great deal across positions. It’s expected that all data scientists and Airbnb will be accountable for their work and able to take a project from start to finish successfully. These qualities help make individuals good employees. Additionally, on the business front, communication skills, the ability to work on teams, and being a successful problem solver are expectations of all data scientists. 9.0.3.7 Claire’s However, data scientists are being hired at companies across the world. Airbnb is certainly not the only company. Thus, here we’ll look at a job description for a “Junior Data Scientist” at Claire’s. For this position, the job description starts by explaining that the person in this position is responsible for using data to make decisions on “promotions, space planning, competitive landscape and ad hoc analyses.” The description then lists “Responsibilities”, “Qualifications + Experience”, and “Preferred Qualifications.” Among these are a number of required technical skills, including programming, statistics, and data visualization. {format: png} Beyond technical skills, this position is looking for an individual who is a strong team member and who is willing to teach others. {format: png} Finally, this data scientist would be able to communicate their findings via reports that could be understood by partners and business users. {format: png} Here, while a different company than Airbnb, in this data scientist job posting at Claire’s, we can see that technical skills, work principles, and business skills are all still required for this position. 9.0.3.8 Allstate For one final example, we’ll look at a job posting from Allstate. The job posting for this “Data Scientist” position begins by explaining the benefits of working in the insurance field and describes the impact this individual would have. After this, the key responsibilities and job qualifications are listed. Among these, many technical skills are required, including statistical and machine learning knowledge and experience, programming skills, and the ability to work with large datasets. {format: png} For work principles, this job description is looking for an individual will to teach others, to be flexible in and capable of learning new technologies, and to be dependable. {format: png} Finally, Allstate is looking for someone who is able to communicate written and oral data-centric information effectively and to present well to others. {format: png} 9.0.4 Which Job is Right For You? Of the job descriptions above, which job is right for you? Well, at this point, if your skills are limited to what’s been taught in this course, you aren’t yet fully-versed in machine learning. Thus, the analytics position at Airbnb or the junior data scientist position at Claire’s may be the best fits. As you continue your education and garner more experience in machine learning or artificial intelligence, you can work toward acquiring the skills required by the other data scientist positions. Thus, looking for jobs now (which we’ll discuss in detail in the next lesson!) that fit your current qualifications will likely mean looking for “data analytics” or “data science” positions that don’t focus on machine learning, but more work can help you move into those other positions! 9.0.5 Summary In this lesson we’ve discussed the basic parts of job descriptions and walked through five actual data science job descriptions. We’ve demonstrated that having technical skills, adhering to important work principles, and having solid business skills (such as being an effective communicator) are required for every position. The details of which technical skills are required differs from one position to the next, so it’s ideal to apply to positions that best fit your current skill set. Then, with experience and more training, you’ll increase your skills and open the doors to additional positions. {format: png} 9.0.6 Additional Resources 7 Types of Data Science Job Profiles What Do Companies Look for In Entry-Level Data Scientists /Analysts? One Data Science Job Doesn’t Fit All What Data Scientists Really Do 9.0.7 Slides and Video Data Science Job Descriptions Slides "],["where-to-look-for-data-science-jobs.html", "Chapter 10 Where To Look for Data Science Jobs", " Chapter 10 Where To Look for Data Science Jobs Now that we’ve discussed what you’ll need to apply to jobs, including a resume and cover letter, what steps to take to update your professional social media presence, including an updated website, GitHub, LinkedIn and active Twitter, and what a job description looks like, we’re ready to discuss where you actually find data science jobs. There are a number of locations where jobs are posted. We’ll walk through them now and discuss the strengths of each platform. We’ll finish out this lesson discussing the steps to take when applying to a position. These will vary from one job to the next, so we won’t discuss specifics in this process, but we’ll walk you through generally. 10.0.1 What Jobs to Look For We mentioned this briefly in the last lesson, but there will be data scientist positions for which you will not be qualified if this program is the extent of your data science training. That’s ok! It makes sense that individuals who have been learning and gaining experience for years will be better suited for higher level or more advanced data science positions! With more training and experience, you’ll get there too. For now though, it’s best to read job descriptions carefully. If it’s a machine learning-focused position and you are unfamiliar with most of the words in the job description, that’s probably not the right position for you. There’s no need to apply to that job. However, you do not need to have exactly every qualification and skill listed on the job posting. If you have most of the skills they’re requesting and are willing to learn the few with which you’re less familiar, it is ok to apply to that position! Thus, given the training in this Course Set, you’ll want to focus on positions where data wrangling, data visualization, basic analysis, and report generation and presentations are the focus. These may have the title “data analyst”, “junior data scientist”, “entry level data scientist” or “data scientist.” Read the job descriptions carefully and decide if the job may be right for you! 10.0.2 Additional Considerations A final note on looking for jobs, you may have limitations that should be considered before you apply to a position. For example, if you don’t live in San Francisco and find a job posting for a job is in San Francisco, CA that cannot be done remotely, only apply to that job if you’re willing to move to San Francisco. If you’re limited geographically, there’s no need to waste your time applying or the company’s time reading your application if it’s a job you’ll never take. Consider whether or not you’re actually interested in the position or if working at the position is actually feasible before applying. 10.0.3 Job Titles to Search In the rest of this lesson we’ll focus in on where to search for positions and the strengths of each; however, before we do so, it’s important to note that data scientist positions do not always have the title data scientist. We’ve mentioned above that “data scientist,” “data analyst”, “junior data scientist”, and “entry level data scientist” may be great terms to search. But, data science positions are also sometimes “product analyst”,“quantitative analyst,” or “research scientist.” While you may not be qualified for every position with each of these titles, it’s good to search broadly. Search each of these terms, read a few job descriptions, and determine if there are positions with these job titles that match your skills. It’s best to have the widest pool of possible jobs before deciding where you’ll apply! 10.0.4 StackOverflow Jobs One great place to search for positions is at StackOverflow Jobs. StackOverflow posts jobs for developers. There are many different types of job listings on this site; however, all jobs listed here require some programming/developer skills. Thus, among these will be data scientist positions. {format: png} On this site, you can search jobs by tags. For example if you type R AND data science into the search bar, data scientist positions looking for programmers who know R will show up. {format: png} You can further narrow your search by entering a location where you want to find a job. For example, if you enter “Baltimore, MD” into the “Located anywhere” box, positions within a 20 mile radius will be listed. {format: png} Additionally, you can click “Create alert” to send yourself alerts when jobs of interest to you are listed in the future, helping to keep you updated with the latest applicable postings as you search for positions! 10.0.5 LinkedIn Jobs are also posted on LinkedIn. Similar to StackOverflow’s jobs, positions can be searched by title and Location. However, the jobs posted on LinkedIn will span many more fields, so there will be a larger pool of total jobs to go through. {format: png} One advantage of jobs on LinkedIn is that your full LinkedIn profile will help LinkedIn identify jobs that may be of interest to you. You can search through their suggestions to see if any of them are a good fit! {format: png} If you carry out a search, the results can be further filtered by “Location”, “Date Posted”, “Job Type”, “Industry”, and “Company” to help hone in on the best position for you. As with StackOverflow, it’s possible to create an alert that will update you whenever applicable positions are posted in the future! {format: png} 10.0.6 Job Boards The final official platform to search for positions are on job boards. There are a number of websites where you should search for data science positions. A few or the most popular are indeed, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter, and Monster. There will likely be overlap between the jobs posted on these sites and even with LinkedIn and StackOverflow; however, you wouldn’t want to miss the position that’s right for you because you didn’t do a quick search. Gather all the information you can about open positions on all the job boards as you start your search! 10.0.7 Company websites In addition to searching on these websites where jobs are posted, if there is a company you’re particularly interested in working for, check their website directly for position openings. They may not have anything open, but it doesn’t hurt to check! 10.0.8 Twitter The last suggestion we have for hearing about new positions is to keep an eye out on Twitter. There isn’t an official platform; however, data scientists and companies that hire data scientists will often tweet about open positions. By following data scientists on Twitter, being active on Twitter, and checking Twitter, you may hear about a position that you would have missed otherwise. {format: png} 10.0.9 Remote Work 10.0.10 Applying Once you’ve identified a number of positions to which you’ll apply, you’ll need to actually apply. The platform may look different from one site to the next but you’ll generally have to provide: Contact Information Materials (resume + cover letter) Additional information about the job + posting {format: png} 10.0.10.1 Contact Information Despite the fact that your contact information is on your resume, most online platforms will require you to enter this information separately 10.0.10.2 Materials These forms will also have a place for you to upload your resume and cover letter. A reminder here that these should ideally be in PDF format. 10.0.10.3 Additional Information You’ll also be asked frequently about how you heard about this position and information about whether or not you’re authorized to work in the United States. Provide this information along with any other optional information that they’ve requested and that you’re comfortable sharing. 10.0.10.4 Proofread Once you’ve entered all the information into the form and uploaded all necessary documents, look carefully over all the information you’ve provided. Verify that it’s correct and check for typos. Then, hit the “Apply” button to submit! 10.0.11 Summary In this lesson we covered what types of terms to use for job searches, where to carry out those searches, and generally how to apply to a job once you’ve found a good fit! 10.0.12 Additional Resources Advice For Applying To Data Science Jobs 10.0.13 Slides and Video Where To Look for Data Science Jobs Slides "],["where-to-find-remote-data-science-jobs.html", "Chapter 11 Where To Find Remote Data Science Jobs", " Chapter 11 Where To Find Remote Data Science Jobs One of the barriers to a job in data science has been that data science positions have historically required individuals to move to one of the tech hubs throughout the world, such as Silicon Valley in California, for their job. However, over time, there has been a move by many companies to allow for more remote work. This has sometimes meant that individuals could work from home a few days a week while requiring that individual physically be in the office for the rest of the time. But, there has also been a shift to allowing individuals to work remotely full-time. The course work in this Course Set has been developed so that it can be done from anywhere as we recognize that most individuals cannot simply uproot their lives and move to where the courses are being taught. Similarly, we wanted to dedicate a lesson to how to find remote data science jobs! 11.0.1 General Postings We’ll start this lesson by noting that remote jobs can be listed on any of the platforms discussed in the last lesson. The job description may mention “remote work possible” or may state the location of the job to be “Anywhere.” In these cases, a move will likely not be required should you get the job. For example, for the RStudio careers discussed in the last lesson, the position for each position posted is either anywhere in the USA or is not specified. While many companies have not yet shifted to allow remote work, some have. Identifying companies that do allow remote work, if that’s what you’re looking for, can be incredibly helpful. {format: png} Additionally, if you’re using any of the platforms discussed in the last lesson (i.e. StackOverflow, LinkedIn, etc.), you can often specify that you’re looking for remote positions in your search. For example, on StackOverflow you specify that the location is “remote,” you will get a list of remote positions that meet the rest of your search criteria. {format: png} The same goes for LinkedIn, where you can specify that you’re looking for remote positions. {format: png} 11.0.2 Remote OK In addition to finding remote work positions on the platforms we’ve previously discussed, RemoteOK is a site dedicated to hosting job postings that allow individuals to work remotely. Specifically, remote data science jobs can be found on this site at https://remoteok.io/remote-data-science-jobs. {format: png} For example, here we have a job posting for a “Data Analyst” position at Komoot. The job posting looks pretty typical. There is an introduction to the company and a list of key responsibilities for the position. {format: png} However, there is an additional section explaining why working for this company is a great experience. Among these is listed the fact that you can work from wherever you want. {format: png} The job posting finishes as the others we’ve looked at have. In includes a section on the technical and business skills along with personality traits you’ll need to be successful at their company and finishes with what documents you’ll need to apply. {format: png} Thus, there won’t be much difference between the job postings that allow remote work and those positions that do not. However, if being able to work from home matters to you or if you are unable to re-locate, it is important that you focus your search to identify positions and companies that will allow this to be possible. 11.0.3 Summary In this lesson we discuss how and where to look for remote positions, should you be unable to relocate or prefer working from your own home. 11.0.4 Slides and Video Where To Find Remote Data Science Jobs Slides "],["data-science-interviews.html", "Chapter 12 Data Science Interviews", " Chapter 12 Data Science Interviews After applying to jobs, there’s a waiting period. The company has to look over the application materials they’ve received and decide who amongst their applicant pool they want to interview. After they decide if you’re one of the people they’ve decided to interview, they’ll reach out to you via email or phone call. During this phone call or in this email they’ll likely describe their interview process and schedule the next step. If they don’t explain the interview process on this initial call, you should ask. {format: png} Before moving on, it’s important to note that much of this lesson is based on this post from Emily Robinson, a data scientist at DataCamp. And, if you want to learn even more about the information in this lesson, read her entire post as well as the information in the other links provided at the end of this lesson! {format: png} 12.0.1 Pre-Interview Phone Calls Sometimes there are one or more phone interviews before the in-person interview. These calls are part of the interview process. You should prepare for them as best you can, just like you would for an in-person interview. The purpose of these phone calls is to ensure that you are who you say you are on your resume, to gauge your interest in this position, and to decide if the company wants to bring you in for an interview. Thus, before the phone call, be sure you know who it is you’ll be talking to, what that person does at the company, and do your best to prepare for questions they may ask you. We’ll discuss the types of interview questions you may get more in the next section. Additionally, always have questions to ask the person you’re talking to. If you have no questions at all, it will look like you don’t care about and are not that interested in the position. We’ll discuss these later in the lesson as well. If there are phone calls and they go well, then they’ll invite you for an interview! Be sure to write down the date and time of the interview and get details about where the interview will be taking place. If it’s in a big office building, be sure they’ll provide you with details on how to get to them within the building. 12.0.2 Interview Preparation Before the interview, you should be sent a schedule or at least explained the structure of the interview. Ideally you’ll have the names of and times at which you’ll be meeting people in the company. If you don’t receive this information a day or two in advance of your interview, you can reach out to your point of contact at the company (the person you chatted or emailed with to plan the interview, typically from HR (human resources)) and ask if one is available. 12.0.2.1 Practice With a schedule of who you’ll be meeting with or at least some idea of the structure of their interview process, it’s time to practice! While there’s no way to know exactly what you’ll be asked in the interview, there are a few general types of questions: Personality Questions - questions asked to learn more about your background, your behaviors, how you would handle certain situations, and about how you work with others Technical Questions - questions asked to gauge your technical competence For personality questions, practice by answering questions out loud. It’s always best to practice interviews the way they would actually happen. Writing the answers down or thinking about them is a good start, but it’s best to actually say them out loud to get more comfortable. These questions range from “Tell me about yourself” and “How did you get interested in data science?” to “What’s your greatest strength” and “How would you handle a conflict with a colleague?” {format: png} As for technical questions, there are many different ways companies assess technical skills. They may explain a technical issue out loud and ask how you would solve it. They may give you a take-home analysis (we’ll discuss these in detail in the next lesson). They may have you live-code, meaning they may ask you to code in front of them. They may ask you to explain a concept (such as regression) to them. These are all fair game. Hopefully, with some idea as to the structure of the interview, you’ll have some idea as to what to expect. Many people have written and spoken about the types of data science questions they’ve asked and been asked in data science interviews previously. Here we list a few types of questions you could be asked: “Talk to me about [fill in the bank]…” “Write an algorithm that does [fill in the blank].” “What problems should you solve with [fill in the blank]?” “How would you approach this problem given this dataset?” Thus, it’s a really good idea to look at resources that are already out there. These are included again at the end of the lesson, but we’re including them directly in the lesson because they’re really important to read over and use when you’re preparing for interviews. Read and listen through these resources - there will be a few quiz questions from these resources at the end of the lesson. Twitter Thread about what questions to ask, from Jensen Harris Questions I’m Asking in Interviews, by Julia Evans VIDEO: Live Breakdown of Common Data Science Interview Questions &lt;- This one is almost an hour. Give yourself time to listen to this video. When you’re asked a question to which you don’t know the answer, don’t make one up. Rather, acknowledge that you don’t know the answer, but think critically about how you may go about solving the issue raised or question asked. Being able to think through a problem is an important skill for a data scientist, so don’t panic if there’s a question with which you’re less familiar. Finally, remember that it’s fair game for your interviewers to ask about anything on your resume. So, if there’s a project you worked on a while ago that’s listed, be sure you’re prepared to answer questions about or discuss it. Practice answering questions out loud. Practice coding. Practice explaining technical topics out loud. Be prepared to say “I don’t know.” This will all make the actual interview much easier. 12.0.2.2 Avoid Giving a Salary Number Sometimes HR or others will ask you what salary you’re looking for. Never volunteer your current salary or what you’re looking to make. If this number you offer is lower than what they intended to offer you, you may be getting a lower salary than you would have otherwise. If you’re asked to give a salary number say that you’re interested in learning about the position, the company, and responsibilities of the job and would rather discuss salary later. If you’re asked again, you can always offer a very big range based on industry standards but state that you’re really most interested in making sure the fit is right for you and would rather consider the entire compensation package rather than salary alone. {format: png} 12.0.2.3 Get Knowledge In addition to practicing your responses and practicing how to avoid giving a salary number if asked, you also need to gain even more knowledge about the company with which you’re interviewing. You probably learned a bit when deciding to apply to the job, but now is the time to go much deeper. Learn as much as you can about what the company does from their website. Search other websites (such as Glassdoor) to see what others have to say about the company and about working at the company (For example, information from hundreds of individuals who have interviewed for data science positions at Airbnb can be found here.) In addition to company knowledge about the company, you also want to know as much about the people you’ll be meeting with as possible. Check out their profiles on the company website, look at their Twitters, check their GitHub accounts, look for presentations they’ve given. Learn as much as you can about what each person does and have different questions ready for each individual. These questions can be about their experience at the company or about that individual’s work – if you listen to a presentation someone gave and have a question, you can ask that question! {format: png} 12.0.2.4 Ask Questions In your research about the company and its employees you should start to gather a list of questions that you want answers to on the day of the interview. These questions can discuss more technical aspects of the position, such as details of how work is done at the company (i.e.”How is code shared?” or “What languages are used by the team?” “When something goes wrong, how is it handled?”) and how projects are managed (i.e “Who assigns projects? How are they assigned?” or “How will my performance be evaluated?”). Alternatively, they could be questions about quality of life and work culture aimed at getting a better understanding of how much vacation time comes with the job, how often people work late or on the weekends, and whether or not working from home is an option. For a more complete list of questions one could ask at an interview, check out Julia Evans’ list here. 12.0.3 The Day of the Interview Once you’ve practiced answering questions and have a number of questions you’re interested in getting answered about the position and company, you’re almost ready for the big day! When it comes to the interview day, your goal should be to learn as much about them as they’re learning about you. Ultimately, the position should be a good fit for both of you. 12.0.3.1 Dress Deciding what to wear for a data science interview is not as straightforward as it is for other positions, where it’s often expected interviewees wear a suit. For data science positions, you likely do not have to wear a suit. That said, it’s always better to be overdressed than underdressed, so if you’re unsure, wear something more formal rather than less. Ideally, you’d be able to ask HR (or the person you first chatted with at the company) how applicants typically dress for interviews at their company. They probably get that question frequently and will likely be very helpful. If they say jeans are ok for interviews, they probably mean it. It’s up to you at that point to then decide what to wear. Ultimately, you want to put your best foot forward, so if they say casual is fine, believe them, but maybe go one step above jeans. Slacks of some sort (or a skirt or dress, if you’re more comfortable) may be the safest bet. Clothing should be clean and ironed if necessary. If they say casual, you likely do not need a tie, unless that’s what you’re most comfortable in! At the end of the day, you want to be comfortable and look professional in whatever you wear. So, only wear clothing that you’re comfortable in and that makes you feel good! {format: png} 12.0.3.2 One-on-one Interviews After the initial phone call(s) and once you’re interviewing in person, you’ll likely have one or more one-on-one interviews. In these interviews, the person interviewing you will likely explain a little about the company, the position, and/or themselves before trying to gauge your background, your technical capabilities, and fit for the position. They’ll ask you questions and should give you time to ask them questions as well. In your questions, you should demonstrate that you have knowledge of the company and have done your homework, but should also get answers to everything you still want to know about the company and position. 12.0.3.3 Technical Assessment While technical questions will be asked in one-on-one interviews, there should be some coding required during a data science interview. This may require live-coding where another person will sit with you and watch you code or it may be a take-home analysis. Regardless of the format, this is where you want to show off your technical skills! Live-coding can be intimidating, but do your best to relax and just complete the task at hand. As for take-home analyses, we’ll spend more time discussing the details of these in the next lesson. While these may seem daunting, it’s an important part of a data science interview. In fact, if the interview process doesn’t require you to code at all, that may be a red flag that the position is maybe not exactly what you thought it was. {format: png} 12.0.3.4 Communication In addition to learning about your background, interests, and technical skills, data science positions often require a lot of written and oral communication. As such, the interview may require you to generate a report or presentation using the results from the take-home analysis you did. Or, they may ask you to give a presentation on some of your past work. For this, prepare as much as possible. Practice your presentation if you’re given time to prepare at home. Proofread your report carefully before sending it back to the company. Know that this is an important part of their assessment of you and do your best to communicate your analysis and findings {format: png} 12.0.3.5 The End of the Interview At the end of your interview day (or two days), you’ll likely be exhausted. Your brain will be mostly used up and you’ll be excited about the position (if all went well!) but ready to go home. This is all normal. But, one piece of information you’ll want before leaving is what the next steps are. You’ll want to know whether or not you should expect to hear from them within the next two days, the next week, or if you should expect it to be longer than that. Get this information. If they don’t tell you, it’s ok to ask! It will bring you piece of mind during the waiting after the interview!. {format: png} 12.0.4 After The Interview So, you’ve had the interview and now you’re waiting to see if you’ll get an offer. During this time, you have more to do than just wait. This is a time for self-reflection. If they offer you a position, do you want it? Is this somewhere you want to work? Will this be a good fit? Are you excited about the position and company? These are all important questions to ask yourself about the position before an offer or a rejection comes. 12.0.4.1 Rejection While we’re on the topic, rejection is normal. If you get rejected from a position or from many positions, know that data science is incredibly competitive. Everyone gets rejections. They aren’t fun, especially if they come from a company and position that was really interesting and exciting to you, but know that they are normal. If you are emailed a rejection, handle it appropriately. It’s ok to express disappointment “I was excited at the prospect of working with you all so I’m sorry to hear that” but always thank them for their time and consideration. {format: png} 12.0.4.2 The Offer However, it’s not all gloom and doom! Sometimes, there’s a job offer at the end of the waiting game. In these cases, the offer may come by either phone or email. However it comes, always respond with excitement and thanking the individual for providing you with the offer. Never accept right away. If the offer comes on the phone verbally, always ask for the full offer in writing. And, after being given the full offer, always say that you need time to review it. This will give you time to think about it fully and in detail. Additionally, this will give you time to negotiate. {format: png} If, after this conversation, you realize you’re missing some details in the offer (health insurance, start date, etc.) you can ask for those details to have all the possible information you may need before responding to the offer. 12.0.4.3 Negotiations Once you have all the information you need to make a decision, it’s time for negotiations. While some people enjoy this stage, many people don’t. So, if you’re uncomfortable negotiating, know that you’re not alone and then negotiate anyway. {format: png} Tech companies anticipate negotiations. It is generally possible to get a 5-10% salary increase from the initial offer. Additionally, if stock options or a signing bonus are possibilities, these are also negotiable. Beyond money, there may be life benefits you’re interested in. Maybe you need to leave early on Fridays or want an additional week in vacation. These are all the types of things you can ask for during negotiations. That said, you should think hard about what you actually would want or need in order to accept their offer. If you ask for more salary and the ability to work from home once a week and they give both to you, there is an expectation that you’ll accept the offer. It would be in bad taste to come back with a new list of demands after they’ve already given you everything you initially asked for. Of course, you don’t have to accept at this point, but only negotiate for a position you’re actually considering accepting. At the end of the negotiations process, if you accept, you’ll have a new job at a new company! Congratulations! It’s a lot of work trying to get a job in data science and the road will often be filled with a lot of rejection. But, when it’s successful, you can end up in a position that is incredibly exciting and fulfilling! 12.0.5 Summary In this lesson, we’ve covered a lot about interviewing for a data science position. Some of the tips discussed are general interviewing guidelines while other are specific to data science positions. However, despite all the information in this lesson, we’ve only touched on the tip of the iceberg. In order to learn more about interviews, check out and read the information in the links below. And, good luck in your job search! 12.0.6 Additional Resources Advice for Applying to Data Science Jobs Red Flags in Data Science Interviews Twitter Thread about what questions to ask Questions I’m Asking in Interviews Ten Rules for Negotiating a Job Offer 15 Rules for Negotiating a Job Offer One person’s experience on the data science job market -Part 1 and Part 2 Two Sides of Getting a Job as a Data Scientist What We Learned Analyzing Hundreds of Data Science Interviews VIDEO: Live Breakdown of Common Data Science Interview Questions 12.0.7 Slides and Video Data Science Interviews Slides "],["practice-take-home-data-analysis.html", "Chapter 13 Practice Take-Home Data Analysis", " Chapter 13 Practice Take-Home Data Analysis A common part of a data science interview often involves some type of take-home analysis. Sometimes, the analysis will take a few hours to a few days and you’ll be given a week from time of receipt to when you have to return the analysis to the company. Other times, you’ll have two hours from time of receipt. The company will inform you of the format and then you’ll be off to complete the project! 13.0.1 Read the Instructions Think of the take-home as a homework assignment. You have your notes and resources (aka the Internet) at your disposal and will be working from the comfort of your computer. This means that when you get the project, the first thing you should do is read the instructions. Then, read the instructions again. Keep reading the instructions throughout the process. You wouldn’t want to do poorly on this assignment because you were unable to follow instructions. {format: png} Often these projects will describe a scenario that you may find yourself in at the company. This is helpful for two reasons: 1. It makes the project realistic, since it’s based off something that actually happened in real life and 2. it gives you an idea of the types of problems and data you’d be working with at the company. It gives you a chance to see if you’d like the work! For example, consider the hypothetical situation that data scientists at Etsy - “a global online marketplace, where people come together to make, sell, buy, and collect unique items.”- give you a take-home assignment during your interview where they provide sales data from their site and information about changes to their site over time. It is then your job to determine what changes were most effective. It would be your job to read the instructions, determine what you need and what you have to answer the question and then to analyze the data. 13.0.2 Plan After reading the instructions through at least twice, it’s time to plan. Take time to think about the question and devise a plan. Think about: What information would I want to have in a perfect world to answer this question? What variables do I actually have? How many observations do I have? What type of analysis should I use? Predictive? Inferential? What statistical analysis would be appropriate for this type of data? How do I plan to visualize the results? What would that look like? As you begin to answer these questions and devise an approach, you’ll want to keep it simple. Remember, this is only supposed to take you a few hours so you’re limited in how much you’ll be able to get done. Start with simple models and then work toward more complex. This is how all analyses should be done, so this will demonstrate that you have a reasonable approach to analysis, rather than just starting with the most complex, confusing, and newest approach out there. Finally, you should be forming your data science question at this point in time. The questions you’ll want to ask in your analysis will likely not be spelled out explicitly in the assignment. It will be your job to determine what the right questions to ask are and what you’ll do to answer them. Consider what the instructions say, form the specific questions you’ll ask in your analysis and be sure that these questions are in-line with what the instructions ask of you. For our hypothetical Etsy example, maybe we decide we’re most interested in answering the question: “Do large overhauls to the website increase sales more than small changes?” This seems like a reasonable place to start and a fairly straightforward question to answer. For this question we’d need to determine from the data we’ve been given which changes were large and which were small. Then, we’d need to calculate changes in sales associated with each website change. We’d use these data in our analysis to answer our question of interest. However, this is not the only question we could have asked. Thus, we would want at this point to refer back to the instructions to make sure the questions we’re asking actually fit with what was asked of us in the assignment. We’d want to determine all the question (or questions!) we’ll answer with our analysis at this point in time and ensure that they’re appropriate for the assignment. At this point you should also be deciding on what tools you’ll use. In an ideal world you’ll know at this point what tools and programming languages the company uses and you would demonstrate knowledge of those. However, do not use tools with which you’re unfamiliar if you won’t be able to complete the assignment. Better to use tools you know and complete the project than to flail trying to learn a completely new language while completing this project. 13.0.3 Analyze After determining the questions we’ll ask during the analysis and with a general plan in hand, it’s time to do the analysis! 13.0.3.1 Data Cleaning The first step should always be data cleaning. Be sure that the data are what you expect them to be. Are there missing values? Do the values you have make sense? Are there outliers in your variables of interest? Explore the data and become comfortable with the information you have before moving on. {format: png} The amount of cleaning you’ll have to do will depend on the data you’ve been given. For shorter assignments you will likely be required to do less than longer assignments, but you’ll always want to check clean the data before moving on to analyses. Trusting the data and not checking it before an analysis is a red flag to any data scientist – you always want to check the data before analysis. 13.0.3.2 Exploratory Data Analysis Once you have your dataset in a workable format, you’ll always want to do an exploratory data analysis. Generate some exploratory plots that help you better understand your data. How many observations do you have? What are the typical values taken for each of your variables of interest? How are they related to one another? {format: png} In our hypothetical Etsy example from above, maybe you would plan to do an exploratory analysis looking at sales over time. You’d generate a plot to look at the relationship between these two variables. {format: png} You’d determine whether or not there are outliers. You’d work to understand any spikes or dips in sales. You’d consider seasonal effects. {format: png} Basically, you’d think about any results you generate. Then, after understanding this relationship, you could add in information about when changes to the site were made and start to understand how those affected sales. 13.0.3.3 Regression Analysis Whether the assignment asks for an inferential or predictive analysis, you’ll likely want to carry out some type of regression analysis to assess the relationship between variables. When you carry out your regression start simple. Your model can become more complex from here if need be, but always start with a simple model and understand and interpret that model before generating anything more complicated. {format: png} For our hypothetical Etsy example, the prompt suggests that this is an inferential analysis looking to better understand the effects of website changes on sales. The assignment does not ask us to predict anything, so we wouldn’t want to use predictive analysis tools. We’d start by assessing the relationship between sales and time. If sales have gone up linearly over time, we’d use linear regression. If there was not a linear relationship, then we’d consider a more appropriate analytical approach, but we’d start with the simplest (while still appropriate) approach possible. {format: png} 13.0.3.4 Visualize After you’ve carried out your analysis, you’ll want to convey your results effectively – this could require a few plots or tables. Regardless, you’ll want to generate visualizations that demonstrate the results of your analysis in an effective an appropriate manner. Be sure that axes are labeled, that the text and points are large enough and that the appropriate graph has been used. {format: png} For our hypothetical Etsy example, you’d certainly want to visualize sales over time. You’d want to be sure the axes are labeled clearly and that the title of your plot explained the important message being conveyed by the plot. You’d additionally want to include either a table of your regression results or a visualization demonstrating the regression line on the data. You’d want to summarize all important results using effective tables and figures. {format: png} 13.0.4 Clean Up With the analysis complete and your question answered, it’s time to get the project ready to go back to the company. You don’t want to hand them an analysis that is messy or a report that can’t be easily followed. Refer to the information in the “Written and Oral Communication in Data Science” course in this course set to generate an effective report or presentation (depending upon what they ask you to do!). Remember, communication is an important skill of a data scientist! Communicating the results of the take-home assignment effectively is part of the interview. 13.0.4.1 Organize Throughout your analysis process you’ll have written code and generated plots that do not need to be in your final report or presentation. After you’ve done the analysis, you’ll want to take the time to determine what code and which plots you’ll need to tell a story. Organize your thoughts and plan how you’ll want your final report to be organized. 13.0.4.2 Write it Up Once organized, it’s time to write up your report. Be sure this report tells a story. It should include the questions you were asking, a description of the dataset, an explanation of your approach, your analysis, your results, and a conclusion. Include clear explanations of what you did, the code, and all necessary graphs and tables. For our purposes, this will likely be an R Markdown report, which is a great way to communicate an analysis effectively. 13.0.4.3 Proofread Last but not least, you’ll likely be tired at this point in the process but don’t skip proofreading. Take the last few minutes to read what you’ve written, to check for typos, and to make sure it all makes sense. Attention to detail is important for data scientists, so be sure to hand over an analysis that has been proofread and is clear. 13.0.5 Take-Home Examples To finish off this lesson, we wanted to include an example take-home analysis that you may be given on a data science interview. 13.0.5.1 Dollar Sales Prediction This first example provides you a good idea with something that applicants may be asked to complete in their interview. This example comes from the Data Science team at The Hershey Company. For this example, all the information you see in this lesson would be the information that would be provided to the applicant. This would be provided in the form of a two page document. The document begins with a brief explanation of the exercise: {format: png} This introduction gives the applicant an idea of how much data they’ll be working with (~20,000 observations and 19 variables) and what their goal is (to predict dollar sales). Accompanying this document there would be three datasets that the applicant would use to complete this task: {format: png} Additionally, the applicant is provided a description of the promotion tactics included in the dataset: {format: png} The applicant also gets a data dictionary, or an explanation of what each variable in the dataset is. {format: png} Last but not least, the applicant would be provided further directions and scoring criteria. This part of the document should be *read multiple times, as it makes clear what the applicant is expected to do and in what form your response should be submitted. {format: png} Specifically, for this example, when you go to consider what tools you’re going to use, after reading the directions, it becomes clear that you’re limited to either R or Python. When it comes to considering what type of analysis you’ll be doing, you know off the bat that this is prediction (and not inference), since the title is “Predictive Modeling Exercise.” The directions also specify that at least two models should be used. You want to be sure you follow this instruction. And, you must explain why you chose one method over the other. It is specified in the directions that two files must be submitted. Thus, you need to be sure if you’re the applicant that you submit both files at the end. The authors of this take-home also give you a little bit of direction. They inform the applicants that they’ll be using RMSE (root mean squared error) to assess the predictions and will be looking at how you thought through and addressed the analysis. 13.0.5.2 Data Analyst at Wikimedia Foundation Our second example comes from Wikimedia Foundation. The full example can be found on GitHub. This task would be asked of applicants who have applied to be a Data Analysts in the Discovery department at the Foundation. The example task that the applicant would be provided first gives the applicant some background about the type of data they’ll be working with. {format: png} The applicant is informed that the team is interested in clickthrough rate and zero results rate. These two terms are defined in this background information and the applicant is informed that they’ll be working with Event Log data. After the background, the applicant’s task is laid out. The instructions here specify that a reproducible report must be generated (You know how to do that in R Markdown!). {format: png} There are then four questions that the applicant must answer using the data they’re provided. After defining the task, the dataset is explained, defining each variable and its type. {format: png} Last but not least, an example session is provided to give the applicant some idea of what the data they’ll be working with looks like. {format: png} And, with that the applicant is off to complete the Task 13.0.5.3 Examples Summary The goal here was not to provide enough information to walk you step-by-step through each example and explain how to complete the task. Instead, the goal here was to give you an idea of what types of tasks are asked of data scientists during interviews. That said, the data are available for the Wikimedia example, so feel free to play around with the data and give it a go! 13.0.6 Summary In this lesson, we’ve introduced the take-home data analysis that is a part of most data science interviews. We’ve discussed how to approach this part of the interview and provided two examples of the types of tasks that applicants are asked to complete during their interview process. 13.0.7 Additional Resources 19 Free Public Data Sets for Your First Data Science Project Ways to Prepare for the Data Challenge 13.0.8 Slides and Video Practice Take-Home Data Analysis Slides "],["data-science-meetups.html", "Chapter 14 Data Science Meetups", " Chapter 14 Data Science Meetups A lesson on attending data science meetups is included in this course since these gatherings can be great places to meet people in the field, to network, and possibly to find jobs. However, the main purpose of meetups is not to find a job, thus, we’ve included this lesson at the end of the course. Here, we suggest attending meetups if you’re looking for a job but more importantly before you start looking for a job. Having connections and a network to help you before you actually need one can be incredibly helpful. In this lesson, we’ll discuss where to look for data science meetups and what you can expect if you attend one. We’ll finish off by briefly discussing what data science meetups have to do with job searches 14.0.1 Where to Look Data Science Meetups in your area will generally be searchable on Meetup.com and more specifically at https://www.meetup.com/topics/data-science/. Data Science meetups are happening worldwide! {format: png} If you sign up for an account on the site, Meetup.com will suggest groups for you to join and from upcoming meetups to attend! {format: png} If you find a meeting you’re interested in going to at a time when you’re free, you can let the organizers know you’re going. Note that if you say you’re going and later decide you won’t be able to make it, be sure to go back in and change your response. It’s not fair to organizers to have people say they’re going and not be able to make it. {format: png} 14.0.2 What to Expect Once you’ve decided to attend a meetup, you’ve completed step 1. The next step is to show up. The final and most important step is to network and talk to others once you’re at the meetup. At most of these, there will be a lot of people who don’t know anyone, so know that you’re in good company. It can be difficult to strike up a conversation with others there, but remember, people are at these to meet others in their field or people with similar interests – they want to meet you and are probably also feeling awkward about striking up a conversation! But, since you’re already there, it’s best to put yourself out there and meet people! Often there will be a time to network and chat in the beginning. Then, there may be a presentation or two. Hopefully at the end there’s some more time to chat with others. Meetups are a great place to meet new people and to learn new things! 14.0.3 Meetups and Jobs So far we’ve discussed where to find out about what meetups there are in your area and about how you can learn new information and meet people with similar interests. However, this is a course about getting jobs. Well, admittedly, meetups are not the best place to look for jobs, but they are a great place to build a network and meet people. Meetups are most helpful in your job search if you start going to them and building up your network before you really need a job. After meeting people at these meetups, you can follow them on Twitter or exchange emails to discuss project ideas! This is a great step in networking! However, if you’re at a meetup and are looking for a job, that’s a good thing to bring up in conversation. If the people you’re chatting with know of any leads or know that their company is hiring, they’ll pass that information along to you! 14.0.4 Summary In this brief lesson we discussed the benefits of building your network, attending meetups, and getting to know people in your field in person! Check out the meetups in your area and start to meet people! 14.0.5 Slides and Video Data Science Meetups Slides "],["about-the-authors.html", "About the Authors", " About the Authors These credits are based on our course contributors table guidelines.     Credits Names Pedagogy Lead Content Instructor(s) FirstName LastName Lecturer(s) (include chapter name/link in parentheses if only for specific chapters) -
